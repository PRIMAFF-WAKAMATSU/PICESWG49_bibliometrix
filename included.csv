Thermal displacement by marine heatwaves,"Jacox, MG; Alexander, MA; Bograd, SJ; Scott, JD","Marine heatwaves (MHWs)-discrete but prolonged periods of anomalously warm ocean temperatures-can drastically alter ocean ecosystems, with profound ecological and socioeconomic impacts(1-8). Considerable effort has been directed at understanding the patterns, drivers and trends of MHWs globally(9-11). Typically, MHWs are characterized on the basis of their intensity and persistence at a given location-an approach that is particularly relevant for corals and other sessile organisms that must endure increased temperatures. However, many ecologically and commercially important marine species respond to environmental disruptions by relocating to favourable habitats, and dramatic range shifts of mobile marine species are among the conspicuous impacts of MHWs(1,4,12,13). Whereas spatial temperature shifts have been studied extensively in the context of long-term warming trends(14-18), they are unaccounted for in existing global MHW analyses. Here we introduce thermal displacement as a metric that characterizes MHWs by the spatial shifts of surface temperature contours, instead of by local temperature anomalies, and use an observation-based global sea surface temperature dataset to calculate thermal displacements for all MHWs from 1982 to 2019. We show that thermal displacements during MHWs vary from tens to thousands of kilometres across the world's oceans and do not correlate spatially with MHW intensity. Furthermore, short-term thermal displacements during MHWs are of comparable magnitude to century-scale shifts inferred from warming trends(18), although their global spatial patterns are very different. These results expand our understanding of MHWs and their potential impacts on marine species, revealing which regions are most susceptible to thermal displacement, and how such shifts may change under projected ocean warming. The findings also highlight the need for marine resource management to account for MHW-driven spatial shifts, which are of comparable scale to those associated with long-term climate change and are already happening.Ocean heatwaves displace surface isotherms by tens to thousands of kilometres-comparable to shifts associated with long-term warming trends-potentially driving rapid redistributions of marine species.",2020,,NATURE,584,7819,82-+,WOS:000560290400018,10.1038/s41586-020-2534-z,,#3,Jacox 2020,"",GLOBAL; physical drivers; physical impact
Assessment of the Impact of Pacific Inflow on Sea Surface Temperature Prior to the Freeze-Up Period over the Bering Sea,"Wang, WB; Wang, Y; Zhang, JP; Jing, CS; Ding, R","Warm water inflow from the Northeast Pacific has always been considered a crucial factor in early winter freeze-up in the Bering Sea. There is a strong correlation between changes in sea surface temperature (SST) on the eastern Bering Sea shelf and sea ice area in December. However, there is still limited research on the impact of Pacific inflow on SST on the eastern Bering Sea shelf, resulting in insufficient measurements of the impact of Pacific inflow on early freeze-up. In this article, the definition of marine heatwaves (MHW) is used to extract warm events (with a threshold of the 70th percentile) and cold events (with a threshold of the 30th percentile) from the eastern Bering Sea shelf in November. Self-organizing map (SOM) technology is utilized to classify extracted cold and warm events and the mixed-layer heat budget is ultimately used to explore the factors that generate and maintain these cold and warm events. Between 1993 and 2021, a total of 12 warm and 12 cold events are extracted and their cumulative intensity is found to be strongly correlated with the interannual variation in SST by 99.8%, indicating that these warm and cold events are capable of characterizing the interannual variation in SST. Among the 12 warm events, 9 of them can be attributed to abnormal warming of seawater before November and only 3 events are attributed to warm water inflow from the Northeast Pacific. During the development of warm events, there are only two events in which the warm inflow from the Northeast Pacific has a more profound regulatory effect on warm events in November. Moreover, both generation and regulatory factors of cold events are the net air-sea heat flux. Statistics indicate that the warm water inflow from the Northeast Pacific has a limited effect on SST on the eastern Bering Sea shelf during the early freeze-up period. Changes in local SST are more influenced by the residual heat before November and by local net air-sea heat flux. However, we highlight that long-term ocean heatwaves occurring in the Northeast Pacific can enlarge the residual heat of seawater in the eastern Bering Sea shelf before November, thereby impacting early freeze-up. The frequency of such events has significantly increased in the past decade, causing notable changes in the climate and ecosystem of the Bering Sea. Therefore, it is crucial to continue closely monitoring the occurrence and development of such events in the future.",2024,,REMOTE SENSING,16,1,,WOS:001140483200001,10.3390/rs16010113,,#4,Wang 2024,"",cold spell; heatwave; physical drivers
Impact of Pacific Ocean heatwaves on phytoplankton community composition,"Arteaga, LA; Rousseaux, CS","Since 2013, marine heatwaves have become recurrent throughout the equatorial and northeastern Pacific Ocean and are expected to increase in intensity relative to historic norms. Among the ecological ramifications associated with these high temperature anomalies are increased mortality of higher trophic organisms such as marine mammals and seabirds, which are likely triggered by changes in the composition of phytoplankton, the base of the marine trophic food web. Here, we assimilated satellite ocean color data into an ocean biogeochemical model to describe changes in the abundance of phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) during the last decade's (2010s) warm anomalies in the equatorial and northeastern Pacific Ocean. We find important changes associated with the ""Blob"" warm anomaly in the Gulf of Alaska, where reduced silica supply led to a switch in community composition from diatoms to dinoflagellates, resulting in an increase in surface ocean chlorophyll during the Summer-Fall of 2014. A more dramatic change was observed in the equatorial Pacific, where the extreme warm conditions of the 2016 El Nino resulted in a major decline of about 40% in surface chlorophyll, which was associated with a nearly total collapse in diatoms.Biogeochemical modelling and satellite imagery reveal community level shifts in phytoplankton composition during northeastern and equatorial Pacific Ocean warming events.",2023,,COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY,6,1,,WOS:000948693600001,10.1038/s42003-023-04645-0,,#5,Arteaga 2023,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Ocean Biogeochemical Signatures of the North Pacific Blob,"Mogen, SC; Lovenduski, NS; Dallmann, AR; Gregor, L; Sutton, AJ; Bograd, SJ; Quiros, NC; Di Lorenzo, E; Hazen, EL; Jacox, MG; Buil, MP; Yeager, S","The Blob was the early manifestation of the Northeast Pacific marine heat wave from 2013 to 2016. While the upper ocean temperature in the Blob has been well described, the impacts on marine biogeochemistry have not been fully studied. Here, we characterize and develop understanding of Eastern North Pacific upper ocean biogeochemical properties during the Winter of 2013-2014 using in situ observations, an observation-based product, and reconstructions from a collection of ocean models. We find that the Blob is associated with significant upper ocean biogeochemical anomalies: A 5% increase in aragonite saturation state (temporary reprieve of ocean acidification) and a 3% decrease in oxygen concentration (enhanced deoxygenation). Anomalous advection and mixing drive the aragonite saturation anomaly, while anomalous heating and air-sea gas exchange drive the oxygen anomaly.

Atmosphere teleconnections from abatement of China aerosol emissions exacerbate Northeast Pacific warm blob events,"Wang, H; Zheng, XT; Cai, WJ; Han, ZW; Xie, SP; Kang, SM; Geng, YF; Liu, FK; Wang, CY; Wu, Y; Xiang, BQ; Zhou, L","During 2010 to 2020, Northeast Pacific (NEP) sea surface temperature (SST) experienced the warmest decade ever recorded, manifested in several extreme marine heatwaves, referred to as ""warm blob"" events, which severely affect marine ecosystems and extreme weather along the west coast of North America. While year - toyear internal climate variability has been suggested as a cause of individual events, the causes of the continuous dramatic NEP SST warming remain elusive. Here, we show that other than the greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing, rapid aerosol abatement in China over the period likely plays an important role. Anomalous tropospheric warming induced by declining aerosols in China generated atmospheric teleconnections from East Asia to the NEP, featuring an intensified and southward - shifted Aleutian Low. The associated atmospheric circulation anomaly weakens the climatological westerlies in the NEP and warms the SST there by suppressing the evaporative cooling. The aerosol - induced mean warming of the NEP SST, along with internal climate variability and the GHG - induced warming, made the warm blob events more frequent and intense during 2010 to 2020. As anthropogenic aerosol emissions continue to decrease, there is likely to be an increase in NEP warm blob events, disproportionately large beyond the direct radiative effects.",2024,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,121,21,,WOS:001231201400006,10.1073/pnas.2313797121,,#7,Wang 2024,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Nonidentical mechanisms behind the North Pacific summer Blob events in the Satellite Era,"Liu, YS; Sun, C; Li, JP","The unprecedented North Pacific marine heatwave (known as the Blob) in 2013/14 winter has attracted many research interests, considering its dramatic impacts on the ecosystem and regional climate. Meanwhile, the summertime Blob events have also emerged in recent decades. In this study, we identified four Blob events in the summer of 2014, 2015, 2019, and 2020 during the Satellite Era. Here we show diversity existed in the formation of summer Blob events. The atmospheric forcing responsible for the Blob is the weakened North Pacific subtropical high (NPSH), which contributes significantly to the Blob in 2019 via anomalous shortwave radiation. However, the atmospheric forcing alone cannot fully explain all the Blob events, especially the one in 2020 when the weakened NPSH is absent. Other than the weakened NPSH, the preceding spring sea surface temperature (SST) warm anomalies in the northeast Pacific can persist into the following summer due to anomalous mixed layer heat content and significantly contribute to the Blob. A binary linear regression model considering both the SST persistence and the NPSH is constructed, successfully reproducing the observed Blob variation for the period 1982-2020 (r = 0.76, p < 0.001). The model improves the ability to capture the warm peaks in all four summer Blob events, which either single factor cannot fully depict.",2023,,CLIMATE DYNAMICS,61,1-2,507-518,WOS:000886860400001,10.1007/s00382-022-06584-8,,#8,Liu 2023,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Interannual measures of nutritional stress during a marine heatwave (the Blob) differ between two North Pacific seabird species,"Tate, HM; Studholme, KR; Domalik, AD; Drever, MC; Romero, LM; Gormally, BMG; Hobson, KA; Hipfner, JM; Crossin, GT","'The Blob', a mass of anomalously warm water in the Northeast Pacific Ocean peaking from 2014 to 2016, caused a decrease in primary productivity with cascading effects on the marine ecosystem. Among the more obvious manifestations of the event were seabird breeding failures and mass mortality events. Here, we used corticosterone in breast feathers (fCort), grown in the winter period during migration, as an indicator of nutritional stress to investigate the impact of the Blob on two sentinel Pacific auk species (family Alcidae). Feathers were collected from breeding females over 8 years from 2010 to 2017, encompassing the Blob period. Since Pacific auks replace body feathers at sea during the migratory period, measures of fCort provide an accumulated measure of nutritional stress or allostatic load during this time. Changes in diet were also measured using delta N-15 and delta C-13 values from feathers. Relative to years prior to the Blob, the primarily zooplanktivorous Cassin's auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) had elevated fCort in 2014-2017, which correlated with the occurrence of the Blob and a recovery period afterwards, with relatively stable feather isotope values. In contrast, generalist rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) displayed stable fCort values across years and increased delta N-15 values during the Blob. As marine heatwaves increase in intensity and frequency due to climate change, this study provides insight into the variable response of Pacific auks to such phenomena and suggests a means for monitoring population-level responses to climatological variation.",2021,,CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,9,,,WOS:000746845500001,10.1093/conphys/coab090,,#10,Tate 2021,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Extent and Magnitude of Subsurface Anomalies During the Northeast Pacific Blob as Measured by Animal-Borne Sensors,"Holser, RR; Keates, TR; Costa, DP; Edwards, CA","Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged warm water events that are increasing in frequency and magnitude due to rising global temperatures. The Northeast Pacific Blob was an unusually widespread MHW that affected ecosystems across the Northeast Pacific, from producers to top predators. Temperature and salinity data collected by northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) from 2014 to 2017 show significant (>2 sd) warm anomalies throughout the top 1,000 m of the water column, with peak warming in late 2015. Using temperature and salinity as a tracer of layers of constant density, we looked at how lateral advection may have contributed to the development of the Blob. Temperature and salinity anomalies and the expansion of the water column at the base of the pycnocline both indicate that northward advection of warm, salty water played an important role in the observed accumulation of warm water, in addition to surface warming. These findings contribute to our understanding of the physical dynamics of the Blob, especially the thermal content and structure of the water column, and offer mechanisms for its formation and maintenance, which are crucial to assessing the ecological effects of MHWs now and in the future.",2022,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,127,7,,WOS:000825379700001,10.1029/2021JC018356,,#11,Holser 2022,"",ecosystem response; heatwave; physical impact
Warming From Recent Marine Heatwave Lingers in Deep British Columbia Fjord,"Jackson, JM; Johnson, GC; Dosser, HV; Ross, T","While satellite data indicate that the surface expression of the North Pacific marine heatwave, nicknamed ""The Blob,"" disappeared in late 2016, Argo float and ship-based conductivity-temperature-depth data show that warm conditions persisted below the surface mixed layer through at least March 2018. We trace this anomalously warm subsurface water from the open ocean through Queen Charlotte Sound to Rivers Inlet, on British Columbia's central coast. In Rivers Inlet, deep water below the sill depth continues to be 0.3 degrees to 0.6 degrees C warmer than the monthly average, suggesting that impacts of this marine heatwave have persisted in coastal waters at least 4 years after its onset, with potentially substantial effects on coastal ecosystems.Plain Language Summary The Northeast Pacific Ocean was affected by two warm water events, the first was the 2013 to 2015 marine heatwave, nicknamed The Blob, and the second was the 2015 to 2016 El Nino. Surface satellite data have shown that the warm water was gone by 2016. Using temperature data collected by ship and by autonomous robots, we find that abnormally warm water continues to exist in the open ocean below the surface, at about 140-m depth. In the coastal ocean, we find that deep waters in Rivers Inlet are still 0.3 degrees to 0.6 degrees C warmer than normal, at least 4 years after The Blob was first observed. This warm water could have a big impact on the Rivers Inlet ecosystem.",2018,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,45,18,9757-9764,WOS:000447761300047,10.1029/2018GL078971,,#12,Jackson 2018,"",heatwave
Long-lived cold blobs in the Northeast Pacific linked with the tropical La Nina,"Tang, C; Shi, J; Li, C","This study explores the counterpart of marine heatwave, known as the cold blob, in the Northeast Pacific (NEP) by selecting the long-lived events with the normalized sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies averaged over the blob area (160 degrees-135 degrees W, 40 degrees-50 degrees N) smaller than - 0.75 for at least 5 months. There are 10 summer-peak events with a stronger intensity and 7 winter-peak events. The summer-peak cold blob events are mostly attributed to the vertical entrainment when the mixed layer depth is shoaling. For the winter-peak group, the greater heat loss at surface is the principal factor to stimulate the cold blob, associated with the intense westerly anomalies around the blob area. However, the vertical entrainment generally hinders the amplification of winter-peak cold blobs. Moreover, the advection of colder-than-normal water to the blob area contributes much less for both two groups. We conjecture that the NEP cold blob and tropical La Nina-like state are potentially linked. The summer-peak cold blob event is often followed by a La Nina event in the ensuing winter. On the other hand, the equatorial La Nina-like SST cooling in late summer and autumn in turn enhances the winter-peak cold blobs. We find the subtropical region, particularly near the Baja California, may act as the oceanic bridge to connect the NEP cold blob and equatorial La Nina.",2021,,CLIMATE DYNAMICS,57,1-2,223-237,WOS:000623723100001,10.1007/s00382-021-05706-y,,#13,Tang 2021,"Rob Suryan (2025-10-15 12:58:01)(Select): Focus on ""cold blobs"", but not specifically extreme events.

TRENDS IN RADAR COUNTS OF MARBLED MURRELETS <i>BRACHYRAMPHUS MARMORATUS</i> IN BRITISH COLUMBIA (1996-2018): EFFECTS OF 'THE BLOB' MARINE HEATWAVE AND PREY FISH ABUNDANCE,"Drever, MC; Mcallister, MK; Bertram, DF; Schroeder, BK; Woo, KJ","During 2014-2016, the northeast Pacific Ocean experienced a large-scale marine heatwave (nicknamed 'The Blob'), an event that was associated with die-offs of several marine bird species. The Marbled Murrelet Brachyramphus marmoratus is a small seabird in this region for which we evaluated trends in abundance-for the purposes of conservation planning-during radar surveys at 58 sites in coastal British Columbia, from 1996 to 2018, and for which we determined whether trends may have been affected by 'The Blob'. A hierarchical Bayesian model allowed us to separate long-term trends from short-term annual fluctuations ('year effects') that might have resulted from changes in ocean conditions, and it also allowed us to test whether predicted regional counts were associated with two indices of marine conditions: (1) measured abundance of a prey species, Pacific Herring Clupea pallasii; and (2) sea surface temperature (SST). Province-wide mean annual rate of change in counts was significantly negative, with a posterior median of -0.023 (95% credible interval: -0.033, -0.014); mean rate of change in counts per year was negative for all six Marbled Murrelet Conservation Regions; and trends were significantly negative at the Central Mainland Coast, East Vancouver Island, Haida Gwaii, and the South Mainland Coast conservation regions. Year effects during or after 'The Blob' at West and North Vancouver Island (2016) and East Vancouver Island (2018) conservation regions were not statistically significant. Mean predicted regional counts of murrelets showed weakly positive correlations with age two herring recruitment, and no consistent associations with SST. These results indicate that the marine heatwave did not strongly affect forest-bound murrelets and are consistent with the hypothesis that ongoing loss of terrestrial nesting habitat is associated with population declines of Marbled Murrelets in British Columbia.",2021,,MARINE ORNITHOLOGY,49,1,37-49,WOS:000640797400005,,,#14,Drever 2021,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Two types of warm blobs in the Northeast Pacific and their potential effect on the El Nino,"Chen, ZY; Shi, J; Li, C","In recent years, the predominant marine heatwaves in Northeast Pacific, the so-called warm blobs, have exerted substantial environmental and socioeconomic influences on North America and its coastal waters. We select the historical warm blob events from 1951 to 2018 and divide them into double-peak and single-peak categories by their seasonal evolutions. The heat budget analyses attribute the leading contributor of double-peak warm blobs to the surface heat flux at the first wintertime maximum while the vertical entrainment and diffusion take responsibility for the second peak 5 months later. The positive net heat flux anomalies indicate less heat loss from ocean to the atmosphere due to an exceptionally anomalous high as the northern lobe of the North Pacific Oscillation and intensive easterly anomalies, which counteract with the climatological westerlies. For the single-peak category, the vertical entrainment and diffusion primarily trigger the warm blob and also lead to its termination. Moreover, the single-peak warm blob induces positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies near the Baja California and establishes the Pacific Meridional Mode as the oceanic bridge to convey its influence onto the tropics and trigger the following El Nino around 10 months after the peak. In addition, the subsurface processes, such as the trade wind charging mechanism, also play an essential part by bringing warmer water upwards to the surface and hence cause the positive SST anomalies in equatorial central-eastern Pacific. However, the interim connection between the double-peak warm blob and El Nino is not very clear although their intensities appear to be stronger.",2021,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY,41,4,2810-2827,WOS:000605458100001,10.1002/joc.6991,,#15,Chen 2021,"",heatwave; physical drivers

An anomalous atmospheric ridge over the NEP is known to be crucial for maintaining these warm blobs, also causing abnormally cold temperatures over North America during the cold season. Previous studies linked this ridge to teleconnections from tropical sea surface temperature anomalies. However, it was unclear whether teleconnections from the extratropics could also contribute to the ridge. Here we show that planetary wave trains, triggered by increased rainfall and latent heat release over the Mediterranean Sea accompanied by decreased rainfall over the North Atlantic, can transport wave energy to the NEP, guided by the westerly jet, and induce a quasi-barotropic ridge there.

"Salinity effects on the 2014 warm ""Blob"" in the Northeast Pacific","Zhi, H; Lin, PF; Zhang, RH; Chai, F; Liu, HL","A significant strong, warm ""Blob"" (a large circular water body with a positive ocean temperature anomaly) appeared in the Northeast Pacific (NEP) in the boreal winter of 2013-2014, which induced many extreme climate events in the US and Canada. In this study, analyses of the temperature and salinity anomaly variations from the Array for Real-time Geostrophic Oceanography (Argo) data provided insights into the formation of the warm ""Blob"" over the NEP. The early negative salinity anomaly dominantly contributed to the shallower mixed layer depth (MLD) in the NEP during the period of 2012-2013. Then, the shallower mixed layer trapped more heat in the upper water column and resulted in a warmer sea surface temperature (SST), which enhanced the warm ""Blob"". The salinity variability contributed to approximately 60% of the shallowing MLD related to the warm ""Blob"". The salinity anomaly in the warm ""Blob"" region resulted from a combination of both local and nonlocal effects. The freshened water at the surface played a local role in the MLD anomaly. Interestingly, the MLD anomaly was more dependent on the local subsurface salinity anomaly in the 100-150 m depth range in the NEP. The salinity anomaly in the 50-100 m depth range may be linked to the anomaly in the 100-150 m depth range by vertical advection or mixing. The salinity anomaly in the 100-150 m depth range resulted from the eastward transportation of a subducted water mass that was freshened west of the dateline, which played a nonlocal role. The results suggest that the early salinity anomaly in the NEP related to the warm ""Blob"" may be a precursor signal of interannual and interdecadal variabilities.",2019,,ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA,38,9,24-34,WOS:000485996200003,10.1007/s13131-019-1450-2,,#17,Zhi 2019,"",heatwave; physical impact
The warm Blob in the northeast Pacific-the bridge leading to the 2015/16 El Nino,"Tseng, YH; Ding, RQ; Huang, XM","We address the occurrence of the warm anomaly, known as the Blob, that developed from late 2013 to 2015 in the northeast Pacific and its connection with the El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. The warm Blob results from the enhanced second ocean-atmosphere (O-A) coupled mode of variability in the tropical and North Pacific, representing a small part of the Victoria mode (VM) in the northeast Pacific forced by the strengthened North Pacific Oscillation-like atmospheric pattern since 2013. We also show that this second O-A mode reflects the meridional variability through the tropical-extratropical teleconnection and is an important precursor to the ENSO variability. The process is confirmed by the coupled patterns that evolved from late 2013 to 2016 and the multi-year persistence of the warm Blob. We emphasize the role of evolving basin-scale VM but not the warm Blob itself prior to the ENSO variability. Hence, the Blob and the most recent 2015/ 16 El Nino, which differs significantly from the other large El Ninos in terms of the triggering hemisphere, are actually linked rather than independent phenomena.",2017,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,12,5,,WOS:000402550600003,10.1088/1748-9326/aa67c3,,#18,Tseng 2017,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Rapidly Changing East Asian Marine Heatwaves Under a Warming Climate,"Lee, S; Park, MS; Kwon, M; Park, YG; Kim, YH; Choi, N","The East Asian marginal seas (EAMS) are one of the fastest-warming ocean regions globally. This study presents the long-term trends (1982-2020) of extreme ocean warming events called ""marine heatwaves"" over the EAMS and examines the relationships between marine heatwave trends and mean SST warming trends. We focus on five subregions with different influences from atmospheric perturbation and ocean currents: the northern East Sea (N-ES), southern East Sea, Yellow Sea, Korea Strait (KS), and East China Sea (ECS). During the past four decades, marine heatwave duration and intensity in the EAMS have increased to approximately +4 days and +0.3 degrees C per decade on average, respectively. In summer, the positive trend of marine heatwaves is the highest in the ECS, primarily due to the rapidly increasing mean sea surface temperature (SST). In winter, the N-ES reveals remarkably rapid increases in marine heatwave properties in the last two decades, with increasing rates of approximately 6.2 (4.9) times longer total duration (stronger intensity) than the global average changes. Beyond the impact of the rapid increase in mean SST, the N-ES marine heatwaves can be further extended due to the northward shift of the East Korea Warm Current. In general, mean SST changes are critical to the increasing trend in marine heatwave duration and intensity. This study further emphasizes that the changes in ocean circulation may expedite more rapid changes in extreme ocean events, which can produce more vulnerability in some places, such as the N-ES, to marine heatwaves under continued global warming.Plain Language Summary Extreme warming events of the ocean occurring from several days to weeks significantly impact marine ecosystems. This study investigates the increasing trends of extremely high ocean warming, namely ""marine heatwave,"" over East Asian marginal seas. During the past four decades, marine heatwave duration and intensity have increased to approximately +4 days and +0.3 degrees C per decade on average, respectively. Comparing the earlier period (1982-2000) and the recent period (2001-2020), the most dramatic changes in marine heatwave properties, including frequency, duration, and intensity, occur in the northern East Sea in winter, significantly increasing 763.33% in duration. During summer, the East China Sea reveals the most significant increasing ratio of marine heatwave properties, with change rates of 227.07% in duration. Marine heatwave characteristics have a statistically increasing trend in both seasons in most regions due to global warming.

Characteristics and mechanisms of long-lasting 2021-2022 summer Northeast Pacific warm blobs,"Chen, JJ; Li, RL; Xie, S; Wei, JQ; Shi, J","Warm blobs are persistently warmer-than-normal seawaters over the Northeast Pacific (NEP), which cause substantial impacts on marine ecosystems and climate. Recently, the warm blobs occurred consecutively in spring and summer of 2021 and 2022. The warm blob in 2021 was mostly located east of 155 degrees W, while it shifted to west of 155 degrees W in 2022. Based on a mixed-layer heat budget analysis, we find that atmospheric processes positively and dominantly contributed in May 2021 and July 2022. Specifically, less latent heat loss from the ocean caused by reducing background westerlies and evaporation intensified the 2021 warm blob, while more shortwave radiation heating due to decreased low clouds intensified the one in 2022. However, the positive contribution of the atmospheric processes cannot maintain a season due to their strong internal variability. The seasonal persistence of the warm blobs, instead, is owing to the offset between the atmospheric and oceanic processes. We highlight the importance of atmospheric processes in the evolution of the NEP warm blobs in spring and summer, which lacks sufficient investigation but can provide more potential predictability for the NEP warm blobs.",2023,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,10,,,WOS:000980061600001,10.3389/fmars.2023.1158932,,#20,Chen 2023,"",heatwave
Role of Mixed Layer Depth in the Location and Development of the Northeast Pacific Warm Blobs,"Shi, J; Tang, C; Liu, QY; Zhang, Y; Yang, HC; Li, C","Warm blobs are persistent warm anomalies in the Northeast Pacific (NEP) upper ocean. Here, we assess the role of mixed layer depth (MLD) in their location and development based on ocean-atmosphere reanalysis data. We find that warm blobs occur more frequently over 165 degrees-130 degrees W and 35 degrees-50 degrees N with shallow MLD. They are largely confined to the mixed layer, although substantial portions exist beneath it in summer when the MLD shoals. Based on a mixed-layer heat budget analysis, we reveal that anomalous MLD and heat flux contribute dominantly to the surface heat flux term over the study area from May to July and from September to March, respectively, and have a large effect on warm blob development. Therefore, the MLD has important implications for the location and seasonal evolution of warm blobs and temperature diagnosis over the NEP.",2022,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,49,16,,WOS:000843341100001,10.1029/2022GL098849,,#22,Shi 2022,"",heatwave; physical drivers
"Wild populations of Pacific oysters <i>(Magallana gigas)</i> emerge during the blob heatwave in south Puget Sound, Washington USA","Beck, EL; Ruesink, J; Troyer, S; Behrens, M","Marine heatwaves have altered ecosystems globally, including changing community composition and facilitating the spread of invasive species. In south Puget Sound, Washington (USA), non-native Pacific oysters (Magallana gigas) have been farmed extensively for almost a century and grown in enhancement sites, however, they have only recently recruited in the wild. This study explores how the appearance of Pacific oysters was related spatially (eight sites) and temporally (decade) to warmer summer water temperatures in south Puget Sound and compares oyster persistence across five sites where recruitment occurred. The largest recruitment event from 2012-2020 was in the summer of 2015, in the middle of the east Pacific Blob marine heatwave which led to warm water temperatures off the west coast of North America. Throughout the study period, the number of oyster recruits each year was positively correlated with warmer water temperatures. Oyster population densities differed across the five sites where recruitment occurred and generally declined after 2015, but showed no site by year interactions, which is consistent with spatially-variable recruitment and similar post-recruitment survival. Mean oyster shell heights also differed among sites, which could reflect different growth trajectories or recreational harvest patterns. This study supports the claim that warming sea surface temperatures may interact with species introductions to change modern biogeography.",2024,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,11,,,WOS:001187365400001,10.3389/fmars.2024.1292062,,#23,Beck 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Linking the Tropical Northern Hemisphere Pattern to the Pacific Warm Blob and Atlantic Cold Blob,"Liang, YC; Yu, JY; Saltzman, ES; Wang, F","During 2013-15, prolonged near-surface warming in the northeastern Pacific was observed and has been referred to as the Pacific warm blob. Here, statistical analyses are conducted to show that the generation of the Pacific blob is closely related to the tropical Northern Hemisphere (TNH) pattern in the atmosphere. When the TNH pattern stays in its positive phase for extended periods of time, it generates prolonged blob events primarily through anomalies in surface heat fluxes and secondarily through anomalies in wind-induced ocean advection. Five prolonged (>= 24 months) blob events are identified during the past six decades (1948-2015), and the TNH-blob relationship can be recognized in all of them. Although the Pacific decadal oscillation and El Nino can also induce an arc-shaped warming pattern near the Pacific blob region, they are not responsible for the generation of Pacific blob events. The essential feature of Pacific blob generation is the TNH-forced Gulf of Alaska warming pattern. This study also finds that the atmospheric circulation anomalies associated with the TNH pattern in the North Atlantic can induce SST variability akin to the so-called Atlantic cold blob, also through anomalies in surface heat fluxes and wind-induced ocean advection. As a result, the TNH pattern serves as an atmospheric conducting pattern that connects some of the Pacific warm blob and Atlantic cold blob events. This conducting mechanism has not previously been explored.",2017,,JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,30,22,9041-9057,WOS:000416488200011,10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0149.1,,#27,Liang 2017,"",heatwave
"Normal, The Blob, and El Nino conditions: Effects on macroalgal blooms in a subtropical zone of the Gulf of California","Tonatiuh, CS; Alejandra, PG; Margarita, CV","The different oceanographic conditions influence marine ecosystems, particularly on macroalgae communities. For this reason, this study explored the effect of oceanographic events such as Normal Conditions, The Blob, and El Nino in the Southwest Gulf of California, in terms of species richness and biomass of macroalgal blooms. Temperatures in 2013 (Normal condition) were lower than in 2014-2015. The high temperatures recorded in 2014 (22.8 degrees C-32 degrees C) are associated with a warming phenomenon known as The Blob, whereas 2015 was an El Nino year. The anomalies in these two years ranged from 0.1 to 2.8 and from 0.3 to 1.7, respectively, relative to the average for 2002-2021. It was evident that the co-occurrence of The Blob and El Nino modified the patterns of species richness and abundance in the macroalgal blooms recorded in Bahia de La Paz, compared to a year under the Normal condition. The lowest species richness was observed in 2014. Regarding seasonal variability, in 2014 the highest species richness was recorded in spring and the maximum biomass in summer, contrary to what is generally the case in the bay.

"Pollock and ""the Blob"": Impacts of a marine heatwave on walleye pollock early life stages","Rogers, LA; Wilson, MT; Duffy-Anderson, JT; Kimmel, DG; Lamb, JF","The North Pacific marine heatwave of 2014-2016 (nicknamed ""The Blob"") impacted marine ecosystems from California to Alaska, USA, with cascading effects on fisheries and fishing communities. We investigated the effects of this anomalous ocean warming on early life stages of walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) in the Gulf of Alaska. In spring of 2015, pollock larvae were caught at record low levels relative to a 30-year time series. Survival rates were low during the summer, and by late summer, numbers were further reduced, with very low abundances of juvenile (age-0) pollock. Our analyses suggested multiple mechanisms for this decline: (a) Low-saline conditions may have impacted egg buoyancy and survival; (b) population densities of zooplankton nauplii may have been too low to support first-feeding larvae; (c) body condition of age-0 pollock was poor and a bioenergetics model indicated that reduced quality of zooplankton prey, coupled with warmer temperatures, increased the ration required for positive growth by up to 19%, at a time when prey abundance was likely reduced. Thus, walleye pollock experienced a cascade of poor conditions for growth and survival through early life stages, resulting in the near disappearance of the 2015 year class in the population by the end of their first year. These impacts differ from previous warm years and emphasize the importance of looking beyond simple temperature-abundance relationships when predicting species responses to climate warming.",2021,,FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY,30,2,142-158,WOS:000575802700001,10.1111/fog.12508,,#31,Rogers 2021,Rob Suryan (2025-10-15 07:42:12)(Select): suggests the potential effect of low salinity on egg buoyancy and survival.

Arctic warming contributes to increase in Northeast Pacific marine heatwave days over the past decades,"Song, SY; Yeh, SW; Kim, H; Holbrook, NJ","The increase in marine heat wave days in the Northeast Pacific ocean over the past few decades is linked to Arctic warming and sea ice decline, according to analyses of satellite-derived and reanalysis data along with idealized coupled climate model experiments.The frequency and duration of marine heatwaves have been increasing with ocean warming due to climate change. In particular, the Northeast Pacific has experienced intense and extensive marine heatwaves since the late 1990s - characteristically called ""the Blob"". Here, an investigation of satellite-derived and reanalysis data supported by idealized coupled model experiments show that Arctic warming plays an important role in the increase in Northeast Pacific marine heatwave days during boreal summers. Strong Arctic warming has acted to change the atmospheric circulation pattern over the Northeast Pacific and reduce the low-level cloud fraction from late spring to early summer. We show that the enhancement of solar radiative heat fluxes and reduced latent heat loss over a relatively large area has favored an increase in sea surface temperatures and marine heatwave days. An idealized model experiment performed here, designed to isolate the impact of Arctic warming, supports this hypothesis.

This paper aimed to assess the impacts of this phenomenon on the sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (CHLA) levels in the Gulf of California (GC), a high-productivity region. Daily satellite images of SST and CHLA with a spatial resolution of 1 km/pixel were obtained for 2014, 2017, and 2019 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Two disc-shaped areas of around 25 km in diameter were selected in the southern portion of the GC to assess the variability of both parameters quantitatively. An additional site was selected in the PO for comparison and, thus, to better characterize and have a complete vision of these events. The results showed that in the PO, during the periods in which the Blob occurred, the SST values were higher concerning the neutral year (2017), and the levels of CHLA were very low (barely 0.15 mg m(-3)). Within the GC, the results showed the presence of a strong seasonal variability, with maximum values of SST (>30 degrees C) and the lowest concentrations of CHLA (<2 mg m(-3)) during the summer, with maximum concentrations of CHLA (similar to 10 mg m(-3)) observed during the winter months. Contrary to expectations, no dramatic changes in SST and CHLA were observed during the years impacted by the Blob. This apparent absence of negative impacts could be related to different mechanisms in the gulf that ""protect"" to avoid climate disruptions.

Governing factors of the record-breaking marine heatwave over the mid-latitude western North Pacific in the summer of 2021,"Pak, G; Noh, J; Park, YG; Jin, H; Park, JH","During July of 2021, the sea surface temperature of the mid-latitude western North Pacific had increased by five degrees over 10 days. This high temperature was maintained for approximately a month before it disappeared rapidly in approximately five days. The underlying mechanisms of this unprecedented marine heatwave event have not yet been researched through a quantitative approach. The development and decay processes of the marine heatwave event were investigated using heat budget analysis and one-dimensional modeling. In mid-July, an anomalous high-pressure atmospheric circulation, affecting to the reduced cloud coverage and increased solar radiation, anchored where the marine heatwave occurred. The increased solar radiation accompanied by the weakened wind reduced the vertical mixing and resulted in a thinner mixed-layer, which accelerated the sea surface warming. The impact of reduced mixing is as important as the increase in solar radiation. In mid-August, typhoon-induced entrainment mainly caused sea surface cooling. The wind-driven mechanical mixing between warm surface water and cooler subsurface water lowered the SST. Additionally, evaporative cooling by strong winds, which drives buoyancy-driven vertical mixing, contributed to the decay of the MHW. The effect of mechanical mixing on cooling is comparable to that of buoyancy-driven mixing.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,9,,,WOS:000882811600001,10.3389/fmars.2022.946767,,#36,Pak 2022,"",heatwave; physical drivers

The objective of this work was to determine the impact of the unusual and consecutive warming events known as The Blob (TB2013-2015) and the 2015-2016 El Nino on the hydrological characteristics and plankton communities, the lower levels of the trophic web, from January 2015 to December 2017. This coastal lagoon lacks river runoff and primary producers depend on the upwelling's nutrient supply. The environmental variables analyzed were the upwelling index (PFEL-NOAA), the air and sea temperature, salinity, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a. The species composition, species richness and the Shannon-Weiner diversity index were used to describe some aspects of the phytoplankton community structure and its phenology. The biomass and mortality of zooplankton also were analyzed. The seasonal pattern of hydrology was described with data collected in nine sampling stations. An alternative approach used with both biological and environmental datasets was to select representative sampling stations located in the vicinity of the inlet and in the interior of the lagoon. Chla-fluorescence imagery collected by the MODIS-Aqua satellite was used as an indicator of phytoplankton abundance. Statistical analyses included bi- and multivariate parametric and non-parametric tests. Principal component analysis was used to describe the seasonality of hydrological data and the canonical correlation analysis to relate environmental and biological datasets. The increase of temperature at a global and local scale in 2015 had as consequence an atypical increase in the water temperature in the fall of 2015, coincident with the abrupt diminishing of upwelling strength and input of nutrients advected from the ocean. A recovery of these two variables was recorded in 2016 at the end of the El Nino. The most abundant group of phytoplankton species were diatoms. Algal blooms were composed by species adapted to high temperatures and nutrients depletion in 2015, while in 2016 and 2017 were composed by ruderal-strategist species and they were boosted by the nutrient pulses associated with the spring upwellings. The fall algal bloom, typical of subtropical coastal lagoons, was observed only in 2016 and it was confined to the interior of the lagoon where there are local inputs of nutrients. In 2015 and 2016 there was a succession of diatoms and dinoflagellates related to the rising of temperature while in 2017 this pattern changed because of the strong upwellings. The relationships of water temperature and silicate with a ratio of diatoms' cell abundance, was analyzed using generalized additive models (GAMs), showing significant correlations but different trends in some years. The species richness of diatom blooms was high; on the other hand, species diversity increased at the end of spring and early summer. The seasonal pattern of zooplankton biomass showed changes along the 3 years, but the most noticeable was an increase during winter and early spring 2015 and the lack of the usual high values of June-July in 2017. The seasonal pattern of the phytoplankton abundance was different in comparison with the 1982-1983 El Nino while the zooplankton was similar among the three strongest El Nino.The changes we observed strongly suggest that the warming caused by those phenomena highly affected the upwelling strength, the length of the temperate and warm seasons and the hydrology. Phenology of phytoplankton and zooplankton changed after the strong perturbation under the El Nino, and possibly The Blob. The recovery of phytoplankton biomass began in 2017, but its taxonomic composition was not adequate to support the zooplankton recovery.",2019,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,6,,,WOS:000462663400002,10.3389/fmars.2019.00025,,#39,Jiménez-Quiroz 2019,"",""
Two major modes of East Asian marine heatwaves,"Lee, S; Park, MS; Kwon, M; Kim, YH; Park, YG","We show two major modes of East Asian marine heatwaves (MHWs) associated with two contrasting sea surface temperature patterns over the subtropical western North Pacific (WNP). In the first MHW mode, ocean warming over East Asia occurs along with the subtropical WNP from the earlier winter by an El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The basin-wide ocean warming is finally intensified to an extreme warming state around East Asia, where a high-pressure region in zonal waves across the Eurasian continent passes. In contrast, at the early stage, the second MHW mode is unfavorable with ocean cooling. However, MHWs over East Asia occur due to a significant intensification of a zonally elongated high-pressure zone in response to anomalous subtropical convection in addition to mid-latitude zonal waves. Due to the importance of persistent ocean warming as well as immediate atmospheric forcing, MHW inducible oceanic and atmospheric interactions are clearly distinguishable from those of atmospheric heatwaves.",2020,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,15,7,,WOS:000615738900001,10.1088/1748-9326/ab8527,,#41,Lee 2020,"",""

Six groundfish species were considered: Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus), northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra), and southern rock sole (Lepidopsetta bilineata). Ontogenetic differences were examined by dividing data for each fish species into size classes. Our study demonstrated that after accounting for size-specific depth preferences, the spatial responses of groundfish to anomalous ocean conditions differed by species and foraging guild in the central Gulf of Alaska. Pacific cod and arrowtooth flounder showed similar responses to ocean warming, but different responses to cooling. In general, Pacific cod moved to deeper depths in warmer years and moved to shallower depths in colder years. Arrowtooth flounder also moved deeper in warmer years. However, in colder years, large arrowtooth flounder (>40 cm) shifted toward shallower depths while smaller-sized fish shifted toward deeper depths. In warmer years, large pollock (>30 cm) moved to deeper waters while smaller pollock (10-20 cm) moved to shallower waters.

Unlike the original Blob, Blob 2.0 peaked in the summer, a season when little is known about the physical drivers of such events. We show that Blob 2.0 primarily results from a prolonged weakening of the North Pacific High-Pressure System. This reduces surface winds and decreases evaporative cooling and wind-driven upper ocean mixing. Warmer ocean conditions then reduce low-cloud fraction, reinforcing the marine heatwave through a positive low-cloud feedback. Using an atmospheric model forced with observed SSTs, we also find that remote SST forcing from the central equatorial and, surprisingly, the subtropical North Pacific Ocean contribute to the weakened North Pacific High. Our multi-faceted analysis sheds light on the physical drivers governing the intensity and longevity of summertime North Pacific marine heatwaves.

Subsurface Evolution and Persistence of Marine Heatwaves in the Northeast Pacific,"Scannell, HA; Johnson, GC; Thompson, L; Lyman, JM; Riser, SC","The reappearance of a northeast Pacific marine heatwave (MHW) sounded alarms in late summer 2019 for a warming event on par with the 2013-2016 MHW known as The Blob. Despite these two events having similar magnitudes in surface warming, differences in seasonality and salinity distinguish their evolutions. We compare and contrast the ocean's role in the evolution and persistence of the 2013-2016 and 2019-2020 MHWs using mapped temperature and salinity data from Argo floats. An unusual near-surface freshwater anomaly in the Gulf of Alaska during 2019 increased the stability of the water column, preventing the MHW from penetrating deep as strongly as the 2013-2016 event. This freshwater anomaly likely contributed to the intensification of the MHW by increasing the near-surface buoyancy. The gradual buildup of subsurface heat content throughout 2020 in the region suggests the potential for persistent ecological impacts.Plain Language Summary Surface marine heatwaves (MHWs) are periods of prolonged and extremely warm regional sea surface temperature that can negatively impact the health and productivity of marine ecosystems. Using surface and subsurface ocean observations, we compare and contrast two recent MHWs to show that salinity variations play an important role in the vertical distribution of temperature anomalies by changing the overall stability of the water column. During the 2019-2020 MHW, the near-surface waters in the Gulf of Alaska were fresher than normal, preventing warm sea surface temperatures from mixing as deeply into the subsurface as in the 2013-2016 MHW. The freshening in 2019 likely enhanced warming in the buoyant surface layer. As warmer temperatures gradually mix downward they can persist long after the surface MHW disappears, suggesting that the ocean can provide memory for long-lived MHWs. The subsurface persistence of MHWs has potential ramifications for long-lasting ecological impacts.Key PointsReturn of The Blob, with warming and freshening, hence more buoyancy Summertime heatwaves, increase stratification, inhibit mixing Wintertime mixing, warming penetrates the deep, provides memory",2020,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,47,23,,WOS:000598677000038,10.1029/2020GL090548,,#47,Scannell 2020,"",heatwave; physical drivers; physical impact

The anomalous high temperatures reached the U.S. Pacific Northwest continental shelf toward the end of 2014 and primarily entered the Salish Sea waters through an existing strong estuarine exchange. Elevated temperatures up to + 2.3 degrees C were observed at the monitoring stations throughout 2015 and 2016 relative to 2013 before dissipating in 2017. The hydrodynamic and biogeochemical responses to this circulating high-temperature event were examined using the Salish Sea Model over a 5-year window from 2013 to 2017. Responses of conventional water-quality indicator variables, such as temperature and salinity, nutrients and phytoplankton, zooplankton, dissolved oxygen, and pH, were evaluated relative to a baseline without the marine heatwave forcing. The simulation results relative to 2014 show an increase in biological activity (+14%, and 6% Delta phytoplankton biomass, respectively) during the peak heatwave year 2015 and 2016 propagating toward higher zooplankton biomass (+14%, +18% Delta mesozooplankton biomass). However, sensitivity tests show that this increase was a direct result of higher freshwater and associated nutrient loads accompanied by stronger estuarine exchange with the Pacific Ocean rather than warming due to the heatwave.

Changes in subcanopy and understory algal assemblages were also evident; however, the response varied among islands.

The Role of Clouds and Surface Heat Fluxes in the Maintenance of the 2013-2016 Northeast Pacific Marine Heatwave,"Schmeisser, L; Bond, NA; Siedlecki, SA; Ackerman, TP","Starting in late 2013, the Northeast (NE) Pacific Ocean experienced anomalously warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) that persisted for over 2 years. This marine heatwave, known as ""the Blob,"" produced many devastating ecological impacts with socioeconomic implications for coastal communities. The warm waters observed during the NE Pacific 2013/2016 marine heatwave altered the surface energy balance and disrupted ocean-atmosphere interactions in the region. In principle, ocean-atmosphere interactions following the formation of the marine heatwave could have perpetuated warm SSTs through a positive SST-cloud feedback. The actual situation was more complicated. While reanalysis data show a decrease in boundary layer cloud fraction and an increase in downward shortwave radiative flux at the surface coincident with warm SSTs, this was accompanied by an increase in longwave radiative fluxes at the surface, as well as an increase in sensible and latent heat fluxes out of the ocean mixed layer. The result is a small negative net heat flux anomaly (compared to the anomalies of the individual terms contributing to the net heat flux).

Analysis combining microscopic observations with environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of the ethanol preservative of an ichthyoplankton biorepository spanning a 23 years time series captures major and sometimes unexpected changes to fish assemblages in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem during and after the 2014-2016 Pacific Marine Heatwave. Joint modeling efforts reveal patterns of tropicalization with increases in southern, mesopelagic species and associated declines in commercially important temperate fish species (e.g., North Pacific Hake [Merluccius productus] and Pacific Sardine [Sardinops sagax]). Data show shifts in fisheries assemblages (e.g., Northern Anchovy, Engraulis mordax) even after the return to average water temperatures, corroborating ecosystem impacts found through multiple traditional surveys of this study area. Our innovative approach of metabarcoding preservative eDNA coupled with quantitative modeling leverages the taxonomic breadth and resolution of DNA sequences combined with microscopy-derived ichthyoplankton identification to yield higher-resolution, species-specific quantitative abundance estimates.

Atmospheric pathway of marine heatwaves over the Northwestern Pacific,"Noh, E; Kim, J; Jun, SY; Pak, G; Kim, JH; Kim, HG","This study analyzes the influence of the Pacific-Japan (PJ) atmospheric teleconnection pattern and its interaction with oceanic processes on sea surface warming over the Northwestern Pacific. The PJ pattern is a thermally driven Rossby wave that originates over the tropical western Pacific through deep convection and propagates toward high latitudes. It plays a significant role in sea surface warming by inducing anticyclonic circulation and the corresponding northwestward extension of the subtropical high over the Northwestern Pacific. This study revealed that the key processes responsible for sea surface warming were an increase in insolation and a decrease in the ocean-to-atmosphere latent heat flux under the anticyclonic conditions driven by the PJ. This finding provides valuable insights into the role of atmospheric processes, we refer to it as the ""atmospheric pathway"", in the development of East Asian marine heatwaves (MHWs). A detailed understanding of this process will contribute to the prediction and mitigation of MHWs in East Asian countries.",2023,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,13,1,,WOS:001136268000018,10.1038/s41598-023-49833-4,,#58,Noh 2023,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Northeast Pacific marine heatwaves linked to Kuroshio Extension variability,"Silva, ENS; Anderson, BT","Marine heatwave events in the Northeast Pacific Ocean from 2013-2015 and 2019-2020 have had significant impacts on ocean life and livelihoods in the region. Numerous studies have linked these marine heatwaves to known modes of climate variability. Here we show that the observed evolution of the 2013-2015 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave best correlates with the evolution of historical sea surface temperatures in response to variations in the Kuroshio Extension. By using ocean and atmospheric reanalysis data from 1981-2020 and ocean nutrient data from 1993-2020 from an ocean biogeochemistry model, we further report the physical and biogeochemical changes during this heat event and their relation to these same Kuroshio variations. Using these results, we propose an atmospheric teleconnection between Kuroshio Extension variations and Marine Heatwaves in the Northeast Pacific. This teleconnection's influence further extends to the marine biogeochemistry and productivity in the Northeast Pacific region via Kuroshio-influenced modifications to mixed layer thickness.The evolution of the marine heatwave in the Gulf of Alaska between 2013 and 2015 resembles historical sea surface temperature patterns in response to large-scale variations in the Kuroshio Extension, according to analyses of observations.",2023,,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,4,1,,WOS:001081159100001,10.1038/s43247-023-01010-1,,#63,Silva 2023,"",heatwave; physical drivers; physical impact

For both fleets, MHW size had the largest influence on fishing ground area with northern fishing grounds gaining and southern fishing grounds decreasing in area. However, fleet displacement in response to MHWs varied between coasts, as the Atlantic longline fleet displaced farther in southern regions whereas the most northern and southern regions of the Pacific troll fleet shifted farther.

Causes of 2022 summer marine heatwave in the East China Seas,"Tan, HJ; Cai, RS; Bai, DP; Hilmi, K; Tonbol, K","Recent occurrences of marine heatwaves (MHWs) in coastal China seas have caused serious impacts on marine ecosystem services and socio-economics. Nevertheless, the underlying physical process, including local drivers and remote associations, remains poorly understood, thereby hindering accurate predictability. In this study, we reported an extreme MHW event in the East China Seas (ECSs, including the Bohai, Yellow, and East China Sea), lasting for 75 d with a maximum intensity of 1.96 degree celsius relative to 1982-2011 during the summer 2022. This ECSs MHW event was triggered by a combination of anomalous atmospheric and oceanic conditions, including enhanced insolation, weakened surface wind speed, suppressed latent heat loss from ocean, a shallower mixed layer, and upper ocean current anomaly. Mixed-layer temperature budget diagnosis suggested that changes in the ECSs temperature were dominated by the surface net heat flux, largely due to strong shortwave radiation flux, during the development and decay of the MHW event. Oceanic advection also created favorable conditions for the maintenance of the MHW. These physical drivers were further regulated by the westward expanded and intensified western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), potentially linked to the negative phase of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Despite the three years (2020-2022) consecutive La Nina events, the ECSs summer MHWs appeared to be more closely linked to negative IOD events, with a lagging period of 1-3 mon. The seasonal precursor signals of the negative IOD have the potential to affect local physical drivers of ECSs MHWs through regulating the strength and position of WPSH, thus serving as a promising predictor for the ECSs MHWs. The future likelihood and intensity of the ECSs MHWs are projected to increase substantially in the coming decades, largely due to broad-scale warming attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop MHW forecasting and early warning systems, and robust approaches to address climate change.",2023,,ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH,14,5,633-641,WOS:001108391800001,10.1016/j.accre.2023.08.010,,#68,Tan 2023,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Marine Heatwave Stress Test of Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management in the Gulf of Alaska Pacific Cod,"Barbeaux, SJ; Holsman, K; Zador, S","In 2014-2016 an unprecedented warming event in the North Pacific Ocean triggered changes in ecosystem of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) impacting fisheries management. The marine heatwave was noteworthy in its geographical extent, depth range, and persistence, with evidence of shifts in species distribution and reduced productivity. In 2017 a groundfish survey indicated that GOA Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) had experienced a 71% decline in abundance from the previous 2015 survey. The GOA Pacific cod fishery supports a $103 million fishery which is 29% of the groundfish harvest value in the GOA. In this paper, we demonstrate that an increase in metabolic demand during this extended marine heatwave as well as a reduced prey supply can explain the decline in GOA Pacific cod biomass. Although increased mortality likely led to the decline in the Pacific cod population, historically low recruitment concurrent with the heatwave portends a slow recovery for the stock and gives a preview of impacts facing this region due to climate change. We evaluate the intersection of climate change with ecosystem-based fisheries management in the context of GOA Pacific cod with a description of the sensitivities of the ecosystem, how the changes in the ecosystem affected the Pacific cod stock, and a description of how the management system in the North Pacific handled this shock. We also provide suggestions on how fisheries management systems could be improved to better contend with the impacts of climate change such as the effects of heatwaves like that experienced in 2014-2016.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,7,,,WOS:000563823400001,10.3389/fmars.2020.00703,,#70,Barbeaux 2020,"",ecosystem response; heatwave; indicators; resource management
Variations in Summer Marine Heatwaves in the South China Sea,"Yao, YL; Wang, CZ","Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged anomalous warm seawater events that can severely impact marine ecosystems and have never been studied previously in the South China Sea. Here, we combine satellite sea surface temperature and reanalysis products to provide a systematic analysis of variations in summer MHWs in the South China Sea and potential influencing factors. The MHW days and duration, calculated as multiyear average, are mainly concentrated near the Nansha Islands and Beibu Gulf. Additionally, we find significant increasing trends in MHW days, duration, and frequency in the South China Sea during 1982-2020. The first empirical orthogonal function mode accounts for 60% of the total variance and exhibits a general mono-sign pattern over the entire South China Sea. Increased solar radiation and released latent heat during summer MHWs contribute to high pressure in the western North Pacific. The anticyclone induced by the anomalous intensification of the western North Pacific subtropical high and its westward extension bring easterly wind anomalies to low latitudes, weakening the summer southwest monsoon south of 12 degrees N in the South China Sea. The midwestern South China Sea upwelling weakens or even disappears due to a negative wind stress curl, causing basin-wide severe summer MHWs.

Frequency of marine heatwaves in the North Atlantic and North Pacific since 1950,"Scannell, HA; Pershing, AJ; Alexander, MA; Thomas, AC; Mills, KE","Extreme and large-scale warming events in the ocean have been dubbed marine heatwaves, and these have been documented in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This paper examines the intensity, duration, and frequency of positive sea surface temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans over the period 1950-2014 using an objective definition for marine heatwaves based on their probability of occurrence. Small-area anomalies occur more frequently than large-area anomalies, and this relationship can be characterized by a power law distribution. The relative frequency of large- versus small-area anomalies, represented by the power law slope parameter, is modulated by basin-scale modes of natural climate variability and anthropogenic warming. Findings suggest that the probability of marine heatwaves is a trade-off between size, intensity, and duration and that region specific variability modulates the frequency of these events.",2016,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,43,5,2069-2076,WOS:000373109800035,10.1002/2015GL067308,,#72,Scannell 2016,"",GLOBAL; heatwave

Chlorophyll-a levels were low throughout spring and summer at most locations, except in a small region around 39 degrees N. Catches of juvenile rockfish (an indicator of upwelling-related fish species) remained high throughout the area surveyed (32 degrees-43 degrees N). In the fall of 2014, as upwelling ceased, many locations saw an unprecedented increase in sea surface temperatures (anomalies as large as 4 degrees C), particularly at 45 degrees N due to the coastal intrusion of an extremely anomalous pool of warm water. This warm surface anomaly had been building offshore in the Gulf of Alaska since the fall of 2013, and has been referred to as the ""blob."" Values of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO) continued to climb during 2014, indicative of the increase in warm coastal surface waters, whereas the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index (NPGO) saw a slight rebound to more neutral values (indicative of average productivity levels) during 2014. During spring 2015, the upwelling index was slightly higher than average for locations in the central and northern region, but remained below average at latitudes south of 35 degrees N. Chlorophyll a levels were slightly higher than average in similar to 0.5 degrees latitude patches north of 35 degrees N, whereas productivity and phytoplankton biomass were low south of Pt. Conception. Catches of rockfish remained high along most of the coast, however, market squid remained high only within the central coast (36 degrees-38 degrees N), and euphausiid abundance decreased everywhere, as compared to the previous year. Sardine and anchovy were nearly absent from the southern portion of the California Current system (CCS), whereas their larvae were found off the coast of Oregon and Washington during winter for the first time in many years. Waters warmed dramatically in the southern California region due to a change in wind patterns similar to that giving rise to the blob in the broader northeast Pacific. For most of the coast, there were intrusions of species never found before or found at much higher abundances than usual, including fish, crustaceans, tunicates and other gelatinous zooplankton, along with other species often indicative of an El Nino. Thus species richness was high in many areas given the close juxtaposition of coastal upwelling-related species with the offshore warm-water intrusive or El Nino-typical taxa. Thus the California Current by 2015 appears to have transitioned to a very different state than previous observations.",2015,,CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS,56,,31-68,WOS:000369835000002,,,#75,Leising 2015,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Marine Heatwave of Sea Surface Temperature of the Oyashio Region in Summer in 2010-2016,"Miyama, T; Minobe, S; Goto, H","The sea surface temperature (SST) of the Oyashio region in boreal summer abruptly increased in 2010 and high summertime SST repeated every year until 2016. Observations and an ocean reanalysis show that this marine heatwave occurred not only at the surface but also at deeper depths down to 200 m. Furthermore, salinity in summer also increased in parallel with the temperature. The rises in temperature and salinity indicate the strengthening of the Kuroshio water influence. The sea surface height and velocity show that the southward intrusion of the Oyashio near the coast in summer weakened from 2010 accompanied by an increase in anticyclonic eddies from the Kuroshio Extension. The much more frequent existence of anticyclonic eddies to the east of the first intrusion of the Oyashio in summer is closely associated with the weakening of the first intrusion and the strengthening of the second intrusion.

Environmental drivers of persistent humpback whale <i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i> feeding events in a Mexican breeding area,"Ransome, N; Frisch-Jordán, A; Cheeseman, T; Calambokidis, J; Kew, A; Titova, O; Filatova, O; Loneragan, NR; Smith, JN","Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae typically fast for several months in low-latitude breeding areas. Here we report on persistent feeding events during 5 wintering seasons between 2013 and 2020 in a known upwelling region of Banderas Bay of the mainland Mexico breeding area. In total, there were 76 unique feeding events documented (group size = 1 to similar to 100 individuals), involving 201 photo-identified whales, of which 18 were documented feeding in multiple years. The most prolific years of documented feeding in 2017 and 2018 (based on number of reports/individuals photo-identified feeding) followed the strongest marine heatwave ever recorded in the North Pacific. Whales documented feeding in Banderas Bay had significantly shorter mean sighting histories (2.3 yr) than a non-feeding sample (8.7 yr) and were reported to be of small size, suggesting they were predominantly younger whales. Most high-latitude recaptures of Banderas Bay feeding whales were in more northern North Pacific feeding grounds (50.8% were resighted in Russia, Alaska, and northern British Colombia, Canada). A binomial general linear model revealed a significant relationship between the probability of whales feeding in Banderas Bay and sea surface temperature (SST). Specifically, feeding consistently occurred in years of lower than average winter SST (<25 degrees C), associated with La Nina years of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We conclude that feeding of humpback whales is now a predictable occurrence in the upwelling region of Banderas Bay in years that ENSO fluctuations lead to lower regional SST. The magnitude of several years of low-latitude feeding events reported here was likely influenced by climate change induced marine heatwaves that occurred during the study period.",2024,,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,726,,161-179,WOS:001183510500007,10.3354/meps14464,,#77,Ransome 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Projected amplification of summer marine heatwaves in a warming Northeast Pacific Ocean,"Athanase, M; Sanchez-Benitez, A; Goessling, HF; Pithan, F; Jung, TM","Marine heatwaves are expected to become more frequent, intense, and longer-lasting in a warming world. However, it remains unclear whether feedback processes could amplify or dampen extreme ocean temperatures. Here we impose the observed atmospheric flow in coupled climate simulations to determine how the record-breaking 2019 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave would have unfolded in preindustrial times, and how it could unravel in a +4 degrees C warmer world compared to present-day conditions. We find that air-sea interactions, involving reductions in clouds and ocean mixed-layer depth and air advection from fast-warming subpolar regions, modulate warming rates within the marine heatwave. In a +4 degrees C warmer climate, global oceans are +1.9 degrees C warmer than present levels, and regional mean warming in the Northeast Pacific can reach +2.3-2.7 +/- 0.25 degrees C. Our identified feedback processes are projected to further amplify the intensity and spatial extent of analogous Northeast Pacific summer marine heatwaves beyond those thresholds, with a warming reaching +2.9 +/- 0.15 degrees C above present levels.

Most murres died of starvation following a large-scale reduction in abundance and quality of forage fish. To assess murre and kittiwake recovery following the marine heatwave, we monitored their demographics at 2 colonies (Chisik and Gull Islands) in Cook Inlet, Alaska (USA), from 2016 to 2019. Compared to historic data (1995-1999), we observed declines and increased variability in colony attendance and productivity across species and colonies, and predation was widespread. At Chisik, where food limitations were common during historic studies, both species experienced substantial population declines and reproductive failures in all 4 years (2016-2019) following the heatwave. At Gull, a typically productive colony during historic studies, murres failed to fledge chicks for 3 years (2016-2018) following the heatwave. By 2019, murre productivity recovered to about half that observed during historic studies (0.28 vs. 0.54 chicks per pair), but populations had declined by half. Kittiwake population size at Gull declined a quarter from historic counts, and reproduction alternated between complete breeding failures (2016/2018) and high productivity (2017/2019). These multi-year demographic impacts indicate lingering effects of the heatwave on kittiwakes and murres through forage fish depletion and increased predator disturbance, and possibly other stressors.

However, extreme declines in the nutritional value of sand lance in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA, during 2012-2016 indicate that energy transfer from lower trophic levels to predators via sand lance may have been disrupted during the North Pacific marine heatwave in 2015 and 2016. Nutritional value (length, energy density, and whole-body energy) was measured in age-0 and age-1 sand lance collected during July in cool (2012-2013) and increasingly warm (2014-2016) years. The value of age-0 fish was relatively stable, with only minor differences among years for length and whole-body energy. By contrast, the value of age-1 fish significantly declined in 2015, and by 2016 they were 38% shorter and 13% lower in energy density compared to cooler years. This contributed to significant declines in whole-body energy of 44 % in 2015 and 89% in 2016 compared to cooler years (2012-2014). The 2015 sand lance cohort experienced little growth or lipid accumulation from July 2015 at age-0 to July 2016 at age-1.

Additionally, local-scale sea surface temperatures, winds, and marine heatwaves were categorized by global-scale temporal conditions defined by the positive/negative oceanic oscillations of the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Comparing spatial and temporal categories, we observed that years with positive ONI and PDO, in particular the 2014-2019 period, concentrated most of the marine heatwaves and the spring temperature peaks. However, there are some indications of an underlying long-term trend. During the period 2020-2022, when ONI and PDO were negative, summer temperatures kept increasing and wind displayed a higher frequency of extreme events. Mapped kelp showed different trends to these stressors: the coldest and most exposed area showed a constant presence of kelp during the entire period, even dating back to 1972. Warmer and semi-sheltered coasts increased in kelp percentage cover after the positive ONI+PDO period of 2014-2019, and the coasts facing the Strait of Georgia displayed a lower kelp percentage cover than the other clusters. In summary, bull kelp was resilient in the study area, but for different reasons: colder and more exposed coasts had the most favorable conditions for kelp, but warmer and more sheltered coastal kelp beds may have benefited from wind-wave forcing.",2024,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,11,,,WOS:001159602200001,10.3389/fmars.2024.1323448,,#88,Mora-Soto 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Major Shifts in Pelagic Micronekton and Macrozooplankton Community Structure in an Upwelling Ecosystem Related to an Unprecedented Marine Heatwave,"Brodeur, RD; Auth, TD; Phillips, AJ","The community structure of pelagic zooplankton and micronekton may be a sensitive indicator of changes in environmental conditions within the California Current ecosystem. Substantial oceanographic changes in 2015 and 2016, due to the anomalously warm ocean conditions associated with a large-scale marine heatwave perturbation, resulted in onshore and northward advection of warmer and more stratified surface waters resulting in reduced upwelling. Here we quantify changes in the macrozooplankton and micronekton community composition and structure based on five highly contrasting ocean conditions. Data from fine-mesh pelagic trawl surveys conducted off Oregon and Washington during early summer of 2011 and 2013-2016 were examined for interannual changes in spatial distribution and abundance of fish and invertebrate taxa. Overall species diversity was highest in 2015 and lowest in 2011, but 2016 was similar to the other years, although the evenness was somewhat lower. The community of taxa in both 2015 and 2016 was significantly different from the previously sampled years. Crustacean plankton densities (especially Euphausiidae) were extremely low in both of these years, and the invertebrate composition became dominated mostly by gelatinous zooplankton. Fishes and cephalopods showed mixed trends overall, but some species such as age-0 Pacific hake were found in relatively high abundances mainly along the shelf break in 2015 and 2016. These results suggest dramatically different pelagic communities were present during the recent warm years with a greater contribution from offshore taxa, especially gelatinous taxa, during 2015 and 2016. The substantial reorganization of the pelagic community has the potential to lead to major alterations in trophic functioning in this normally productive ecosystem.",2019,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,6,,,WOS:000467017900001,10.3389/fmars.2019.00212,,#89,Brodeur 2019,"",heatwave
Changes in Rocky Intertidal Community Structure During a Marine Heatwave in the Northern Gulf of Alaska,"Weitzman, B; Konar, B; Iken, K; Coletti, H; Monson, D; Suryan, R; Dean, T; Hondolero, D; Lindeberg, M","Marine heatwaves are global phenomena that can have major impacts on the structure and function of coastal ecosystems. By mid-2014, the Pacific Marine Heatwave (PMH) was evident in intertidal waters of the northern Gulf of Alaska and persisted for multiple years. While offshore marine ecosystems are known to respond to these warmer waters, the response of rocky intertidal ecosystems to this warming is unclear. Intertidal communities link terrestrial and marine ecosystems and their resources are important to marine and terrestrial predators and to human communities for food and recreation, while simultaneously supporting a growing coastal tourism industry. Given that current climate change projections suggest increased frequency and duration of marine heatwaves, monitoring and understanding the impacts of heatwaves on intertidal habitats is important. As part of the Gulf Watch Alaska Long-Term Monitoring program, we examined rocky intertidal community structure at 21 sites across four regions spanning 1,200 km of coastline: Western Prince William Sound, Kenai Fjords National Park, Kachemak Bay, and Katmai National Park and Preserve. Sites were monitored annually from 2012 to 2019 at mid and low tidal strata. Before-PMH (2012-2014), community structure differed among regions. We found macroalgal foundation species declined during this period mirroring patterns observed elsewhere for subtidal habitat formers during heatwave events. The region-wide shift from an autotroph-macroalgal dominated rocky intertidal to a heterotroph-filter-feeder dominated state concurrent with the changing environmental conditions associated with a marine heatwave event suggests the PMH had Gulf-wide impacts to the structure of rocky intertidal communities. During/after-PMH (2015-2019), similarities in community structure increased across regions, leading to a greater homogenization of these communities, due to declines in macroalgal cover, driven mostly by a decline in the rockweed, Fucus distichus, and other fleshy red algae in 2015, followed by an increase in barnacle cover in 2016, and an increase in mussel cover in 2017. Strong, large-scale oceanographic events, like the PMH, may override local drivers to similarly influence patterns of intertidal community structure.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000624478200001,10.3389/fmars.2021.556820,,#91,Weitzman 2021,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
A Persistent and Intense Marine Heatwave in the Northeast Pacific During 2019-2020,"Chen, ZY; Shi, J; Liu, QY; Chen, H; Li, C","Motivated by increasing marine heatwaves (MHWs) and their dramatic climate effects, we analyze the persistent 2019-2020 MHW, which showed significant positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Northeast Pacific. Four SST peaks were identified during its evolution, which appeared in November 2019, April, July, and November 2020. Positive temperature anomalies were mostly located within the mixed layer for the first-year winter peak. However, the warm core was centered around 50 m below (at the bottom of) the mixed layer for the summer (second-year winter) peak. The dominant factor for the two wintertime peaks was a surface heat flux anomaly, with reduction in evaporative cooling due to the easterly anomaly. The heat flux and potentially the vertical entrainment combined to induce the peak in spring. In the tropical Pacific, a La Nina event occurred following this MHW, while other recorded double-peak events were associated with El Nino or neutral conditions.",2021,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,48,13,,WOS:000694024100022,10.1029/2021GL093239,,#92,Chen 2021,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Relative Importance of Macroalgae and Phytoplankton to Nearshore Consumers and Growth Across Climatic Conditions in the Northern Gulf of Alaska,"Corliss, K; von Biela, V; Coletti, H; Bodkin, J; Esler, D; Iken, K","Macroalgae and phytoplankton support the base of highly productive nearshore ecosystems in cold-temperate regions. To better understand their relative importance to nearshore food webs, this study considered four regions in the northern Gulf of Alaska where three indicator consumers were collected, filter-feeding mussels (Mytilus trossulus), pelagic-feeding Black Rockfish (Sebastes melanops), and benthic-feeding Kelp Greenling (Hexagrammos decagrammus). The study objectives were to (1) estimate the proportional contributions of macroalgal and phytoplankton organic matter using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, (2) determine if macroalgal use affected consumer growth using annual growth rings in shells or otoliths, and (3) describe changes in organic matter use and growth during the Pacific Marine Heatwave (PMH; 2014-2016) in one consumer, mussels. Macroalgae were the major organic matter source (> 60%) to the diet for all three consumers. The relationships between macroalgal contribution and growth were neutral for both fish species and significantly positive for mussels. During the PMH, mussels had a drop (> 10%) in macroalgal contributions and grew 45% less than in other time periods. Simultaneously, the relationship between macroalgal contribution and mussel growth was strongest during the PMH, explaining 48% variation compared to 3-12% before or after the PMH. Collectively, the results suggest that macroalgae is likely more important to cold-temperate nearshore food webs than phytoplankton. Management actions aimed at conserving and expanding macroalgae are likely to benefit nearshore food webs under all climate scenarios and especially during marine heatwaves.",2024,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,47,6,1579-1597,WOS:001261212600004,10.1007/s12237-024-01371-6,,#95,Corliss 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave; resource management
Phytoplankton Response to the Record-Breaking Marine Heatwave in the Summer of 2020 in the South China Sea,"Zheng, JJ; Xiu, P; Zeng, LL; Zhu, XM; Ji, XL; Gao, S; Li, ZJ","A record-breaking marine heatwave (MHW) occurred in the South China Sea (SCS) during the summer of 2020, causing substantial ecological impacts, while its influence on phytoplankton dynamics remains unknown. Here we employed a regionally optimized physical-biogeochemical model to examine the phytoplankton response to this event. An analysis of the mixed-layer heat budget in the MHW region revealed that the MHW was driven by enhanced shortwave radiation and reduced horizontal advection of cold water, associated with weakened upwelling off the coast of Vietnam. For phytoplankton, average surface chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations during the MHW experienced a significant decline in June and July, and a slight reduction in September compared to normal conditions, which can be attributed to reduced horizontal advection of nutrients associated with weakened upwelling. Furthermore, we found that the reduction in depth-integrated Chla in the euphotic zone was much smaller during the MHW due to the increase in subsurface Chla, which was also attributable to the changed lateral transport. This study highlights the importance of non-local effects of MHWs on phytoplankton distributions in the SCS.Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are defined as prolonged, discrete anomalous warm-water events. A record-breaking MHW occurred in the South China Sea (SCS) during the summer of 2020. We used a coupled physical-biogeochemical model to study the mechanism of phytoplankton response to this MHW. We found that enhanced shortwave radiation combined with reduced horizontal transport of cold water led to the MHW. The surface phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations decreased during the MHW due to reduced lateral nutrient transport associated with weakened upwelling off the coast of Vietnam. Additionally, the reduction in depth-integrated chlorophyll in the euphotic zone was much smaller during the MHW owing to increased subsurface chlorophyll resulting from the lateral transport.The marine heatwave (MHW) was driven by enhanced shortwave radiation and reduced horizontal advection of cold water The decrease in surface chlorophyll-a (Chla) during the MHW was primarily caused by reduced horizontal advection of nutrients The reduction in depth-integrated Chla in the euphotic zone was much smaller during the MHW due to the increase in subsurface Chla",2024,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,129,10,,WOS:001335368200001,10.1029/2024JC021275,,#96,Zheng 2024,"Rob Suryan (2025-10-17 07:46:00)(Select): Included, but results are model-based; ",ecosystem response; heatwave
On the Vertical Structure and Propagation of Marine Heatwaves in the Eastern Pacific,"Köhn, EE; Vogt, M; Münnich, M; Gruber, N","Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been recognized as a serious threat to marine life, yet, most studies so far have focused on the surface only. Here, we investigate the vertical dimension and propagation of surface MHWs in the Eastern Pacific (EP) using results from a high-resolution hindcast simulation (1979-2019), performed with the Regional Ocean Modeling System. We detect MHWs using a seasonally varying percentile threshold on a fixed baseline and track their vertical propagation across the upper 500 m. We find that nearly a third (similar to 29%) of the MHWs extend beyond the surface mixed layer depth (MLD). On average, these deep-reaching MHWs (dMHWs) extend to 110 m below the MLD and last five times longer than MHWs that are confined to the mixed layer (184 vs. 36 days). The dMHWs can cause stronger temperature anomalies at depth than at the surface (maximum intensity of 5.0 vs. 1.9 degrees C). This general subsurface MHW intensification even holds when scaling the temperatures with the respective local variability. A clustering of dMHWs reveals that 41% of them are block-like, that is, continually remain in contact with the sea surface, 24% propagate downward, 20% propagate upward, while 15% appear at the surface multiple times. Although the water column MHW duration, intensity and severity are only moderately correlated with their corresponding surface-based MHW characteristics, dMHWs have the potential to be detected from the surface. Our study can help to augment the remote sensing-based monitoring of upper ocean exposure to MHWs.Periods of extremely warm water temperatures, referred to as marine heatwaves (MHWs), pose a serious threat to marine life. While many studies have analyzed MHW properties at the sea surface, little is known about their subsurface nature. We here use a new approach to define MHWs throughout the water column and study the vertical structure and propagation behavior of MHWs in the Eastern Pacific based on a high-resolution numerical hindcast simulation (1979-2019). We find that nearly a third of MHWs that are discernible at the sea surface reach below the layer of well-mixed waters near the sea surface, the so-called mixed layer (ML). These deep-reaching MHWs (dMHWs) last on average longer than ML confined MHWs (184 vs. 36 days) and are marked by larger temperature threshold exceedances (maximum intensity of 5.0 vs. 1.9 degrees C). We furthermore identify four distinct vertical propagation patterns associated with the dMHWs: 41% continually affect the sea surface, 24% propagate downwards, 20% propagate upward, while 15% appear at the surface multiple times. Overall, these analyses show that MHWs can affect the water column to a larger degree than diagnosed based on the sea surface only.About a third of marine heatwaves (MHW) in the Eastern Pacific extend below the mixed layer. Ten percent of MHWs extend on average deeper than 150 m59% of deep-reaching MHWs (dMHWs) are partly invisible at the surface, as they either deepen, shoal or exhibit multi-surfacing behaviorAs initial tests indicate that the surface-based detection of dMHWs seems feasible, dMHWs might be detectable using remote sensing data",2024,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,129,1,,WOS:001138437900001,10.1029/2023JC020063,,#99,Köhn 2024,"",heatwave; physical drivers; physical impact

Physical, biogeochemical, and biological parameters observed at OSP from 2013 to 2020 are used to assess ocean response and potential impacts on marine life from the 2019 northeast Pacific MHW. The 2019 MHW reached peak surface and subsurface temperature anomalies in the summertime and had both coastal, impacting fisheries, and offshore consequences that could potentially affect multiple trophic levels in the Gulf of Alaska. In the Gulf of Alaska, the 2019 MHW was preceded by calm and stratified upper ocean conditions, which preconditioned the enhanced surface warming in late spring and early summer. The MHW coincided with lower dissolved inorganic carbon and higher pH of surface waters relative to the 2013-2020 period. A spike in the summertime chlorophyll followed by a decrease in surface macronutrients suggests increased productivity in the well-lit stratified upper ocean during summer 2019. More blue whale calls were recorded at OSP in 2019 compared to the prior year. This study shows how the utility of long-term, continuous oceanographic data sets and analysis with an interdisciplinary lens is necessary to understand the potential impact of MHWs on marine ecosystems.Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are warmer than normal surface ocean temperature events. In 2019, a MHW occurred in the northeastern Pacific, and we utilized Ocean Station Papa (OSP), a multidisciplinary observing system in the Gulf of Alaska, to present the physical, biogeochemical, and biological impacts. Prior to reaching the MHW's warmest surface temperatures, the upper ocean exhibited a calm and stratified state, which facilitated the occurrence of exceptionally high sea surface temperatures. During the MHW, warm water was present well below the surface and extended throughout the water column. Prior to the MHW's warmest surface temperatures, we also observed indications of increased primary productivity through observed spikes in chlorophyll levels and reductions in nutrient concentrations. Due to data limitations, the connection between this heightened primary productivity and higher trophic levels remains unclear. Our study demonstrates the necessity of adopting holistic perspectives when seeking to understand the complexities of MHWs.The 2019 northeastern Pacific marine heatwave had various offshore physical, biogeochemical, and biological impacts Temperature anomalies associated with the 2019 marine heatwave were observed well below the mixed layer, indicating a subsurface structure throughout the water column Long-term multidisciplinary observing systems are necessary to provide a holistic view of extreme events",2024,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,129,6,,WOS:001251975000001,10.1029/2023JC020167,,#102,Kohlman 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave; physical impact
A More Comprehensive Climate Vulnerability Assessment Framework for Fisheries Social-Ecological Systems,"Dudley, PN; Rogers, TL; Morales, MM; Stoltz, AD; Sheridan, CJ; Beulke, AK; Pomeroy, C; Carr, MH","Understanding and anticipating the effects of climate change on fisheries social-ecological systems (FSESs) is central to proactive fisheries management in a changing global climate. With fisheries management increasingly striving to consider interactions and feedbacks among people, targeted species, and the broader ecological and human communities, fisheries managers and participants need tools to help them assess these complex systems. We developed a new climate vulnerability assessment framework for analyzing the impacts of a climate-induced trend or event on a FSES. The framework divides the FSES into four interrelated and interacting domains: Ecological Community, Fished Species, Fishery, and Human Community. The framework provides a systematic approach to account for indirect as well as direct effects, links among subsystems, and multiple climate change-induced stressors. We demonstrate the framework's utility by applying it to three case studies: the effects of a marine heatwave on the Dungeness crab FSES, the effects of a marine heatwave on the red sea urchin FSES, and the effects of long-term climate trends on North Pacific albacore. We found that the effects of a climatic trend or event on a FSES are often indirect and can trigger diverse and important feedbacks. These examples also showed that the climatic trend or event may cause changes in the temporal and spatial distribution of fishing effort and fished species that have a more significant impact on the FSES than changes to species abundance per se. Unlike other climate vulnerability assessment frameworks and applications, ours is designed to enable consideration of the range of feedbacks within and among both the ecological and human communities.

Here we utilized detected breakpoints and early warning indicators derived from sightings data spanning from 2009 to 2021 to assess the distribution change of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis).

"Marine heatwave events near Weizhou Island, Beibu Gulf in 2020 and their possible relations to coral bleaching","Feng, YT; Bethel, BJ; Dong, CM; Zhao, H; Yao, YL; Yu, Y","Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are events of anomalously high sea surface temperatures lasting for five days or more and have recently been linked to widespread environmental stress on marine organisms, though there are few studies in the Beibu Gulf. This study characterizes MHWs near Weizhou Island (21 degrees 00 '-21 degrees 10 ' N, 109 degrees 00 '-109 degrees 15 ' E) using a recently developed detection algorithm on a high-resolution satellite sea surface temperature (SST) product and considers their potential influence on coral bleaching events. Reanalysis data are used to investigate atmospheric factors in MHWs occurrences. Results showed that among a total of 112 MHWs having occurred from 1983 to 2020, eight discrete MHWs occurring throughout 2020 in Weizhou Island. Interestingly, although not the most intense in 2020, the June 3rd-August 2nd event lasted for an enormous 61 days with mean and maximum intensities of 2.68 degrees C and 1.73 degrees C above climatology, respectively. The reasons for the occurrence and severity of MHWs in 2020 the intensification of Northwest Pacific subtropical high and its extension leading to increased shortwave radiation reaching the sea surface during the summer, reduced typhoon activity in July, weakened wind fields north of 20.5 degrees N, and an enhancement in sea level anomalies.

However, empirical evidence explicitly linking MPAs to enhanced ecological resilience is limited and mixed. To better understand whether MPAs can buffer climate impacts, we tested the resistance and recovery of marine communities to the 2014-2016 Northeast Pacific heatwave in the largest scientifically designed MPA network in the world off the coast of California, United States. The network consists of 124 MPAs (48 no-take state marine reserves, and 76 partial-take or special regulation conservation areas) implemented at different times, with full implementation completed in 2014. We compared fish, benthic invertebrate, and macroalgal community structure inside and outside of 13 no-take MPAs across rocky intertidal, kelp forest, shallow reef, and deep reef nearshore habitats in California's Central Coast region from 2007 to 2020. We also explored whether MPA features, including age, size, depth, proportion rock, historic fishing pressure, habitat diversity and richness, connectivity, and fish biomass response ratios (proxy for ecological performance), conferred climate resilience for kelp forest and rocky intertidal habitats spanning 28 MPAs across the full network. Ecological communities dramatically shifted due to the marine heatwave across all four nearshore habitats, and MPAs did not facilitate habitat-wide resistance or recovery. Only in protected rocky intertidal habitats did community structure significantly resist marine heatwave impacts. Community shifts were associated with a pronounced decline in the relative proportion of cold water species and an increase in warm water species. MPA features did not explain resistance or recovery to the marine heatwave. Collectively, our findings suggest that MPAs have limited ability to mitigate the impacts of marine heatwaves on community structure.

Unraveling the Formation Mechanism of Exceptionally Strong Marine Heatwaves in the Northeast Pacific in 2020,"Ge, ZA; Chen, L; Li, TM; Sun, M","Throughout 2020, a persistent marine heatwave (MHW) event occurred in the northeast (NE) Pacific, which exhibited a record-breaking intensity and long duration. Three peaks of sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly are identified in April, July, and November 2020, respectively, all of which are caused by the surface latent heat flux (LH) term. A Taylor expansion analysis for the LH term reveals that positive LH anomaly (LHA) played the decisive role in increasing the latent heating effect, whereas the mixed layer depth anomaly was not important in the 2020 MHW. The positive LHA was primarily caused by the southerly wind anomalies, which advected more humid air from lower latitudes to the NE Pacific and thus reduced the difference between the saturated specific humidity at sea surface and actual surface specific humidity. This reduced sea-air humidity difference was conducive to less evaporation, leading to positive LHA. Using an atmospheric general circulation model forced by observed SSTs, we find that although the atmospheric circula-tion anomalies associated with the 2020 MHW can be partly constrained by both tropical Pacific SST and local SST over the North Pacific, the role of internal atmospheric variability in the 2020 MHW's formation cannot be overlooked. The pre-diction skill for the 2020 MHW in the North American Multimodel Ensemble models is limited to one month, indicating the challenge of accurately predicting MHW in the NE Pacific. The finding about the contribution of sea-air humidity difference to the LHA provides a new insight into the formation mechanism of MHW. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: An exceptionally strong and persistent marine heatwave occurred in the northeast Pacific throughout 2020, with three peaks in April, July, and November, causing considerable damage to local fisheries and ecosystems. This study found that the evolution of this marine heatwave was due to the less-than-normal release of latent heat at the ocean surface. This was mainly caused by the reduced sea-air humidity difference, which was attributed to the increased near-surface moisture transported by southerly wind anomalies. Our model experiments demonstrated that the associated anomaly fields in the atmosphere partly stemmed from stochastic processes. The state-of-the-art dynamic models can only predict this marine heatwave one month in advance, indicating the necessity of improving prediction skill for marine heatwave's evolution in current models.",2023,,JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,36,23,8091-8111,WOS:001100117300001,10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0947.1,,#113,Ge 2023,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Microclimate predicts kelp forest extinction in the face of direct and indirect marine heatwave effects,"Starko, S; Neufeld, CJ; Gendall, L; Timmer, B; Campbell, L; Yakimishyn, J; Druehl, L; Baum, JK","Marine heatwaves threaten the persistence of kelp forests globally. However, the observed responses of kelp forests to these events have been highly variable on local scales. Here, we synthesize distribution data from an environmentally diverse region to examine spatial patterns of canopy kelp persistence through an unprecedented marine heatwave. We show that, although often overlooked, temperature variation occurring at fine spatial scales (i.e., a few kilometers or less) can be a critical driver of kelp forest persistence during these events. Specifically, though kelp forests nearly all persisted toward the cool outer coast, inshore areas were >3 degrees C warmer at the surface and experienced extensive kelp loss. Although temperatures remained cool at depths below the thermocline, kelp persistence in these thermal refugia was strongly constrained by biotic interactions, specifically urchin populations that increased during the heatwave and drove transitions to urchin barrens in deeper rocky habitat. Urchins were, however, largely absent from mixed sand and cobble benthos, leading to an unexpected association between bottom substrate and kelp forest persistence at inshore sites with warm surface waters. Our findings demonstrate both that warm microclimates increase the risk of habitat loss during marine heatwaves and that biotic interactions modified by these events will modulate the capacity of cool microclimates to serve as thermal refugia.",2022,,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,32,7,,WOS:000842168800001,10.1002/eap.2673,,#114,Starko 2022,"",ecosystem response; heatwave; physical impact
Different Modulations of Arctic Oscillation on Wintertime Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies in the Northeast Pacific,"Chen, JJ; Li, RL; Mao, JR; Yu, WH; Xie, S; Wei, JQ; Huang, H; Liu, QY; Shi, J","Persistent positive sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the mid-latitude Northeast Pacific (NEP), also known as ""warm blob"" or ""marine heatwave,"" have substantial ecological and climate effects. This study delves into the spatiotemporal connection between Arctic Oscillation (AO) and SSTAs in the NEP. First, we conduct the lead-lag correlation and maximum covariance analyses to disentangle the closest temporal relationship between October AO and wintertime SSTAs in the NEP. Then, we categorize the years in positive AO (pAO) phase into two groups: positive AO with warm anomaly (pAO&Blob) group and positive AO without warm anomaly (pAO&noBlob) group based on the October AO index and wintertime blob index. Results show that the positive phase of AO in October strongly influences the wintertime warm SSTAs in the NEP through local and remote pathways. The local pathway is contingent upon the longitudinal positioning of AO-related high-pressure anomaly (i.e., anomalous ridge) in the North Pacific. When easterly anomalies prevail at the southern flank of the anomalous ridge over the NEP, they foster warm SSTAs in the NEP. However, different locations of the high-pressure anomalies may impede the NEP warming. Remote pathways indicate the teleconnections triggered by AO-related precipitation increase in Greenland and decrease in East Asia, sustaining the high-pressure anomaly and promoting the anomalous NEP warming. Hence, this study presents new evidence on polar and mid-latitude climate connections, which may provide potential predictability for the warm SSTAs in the NEP.Under rapid climate change, long-lasting warm sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the mid-latitude Northeast Pacific (NEP) have attracted wide attention due to their substantial ecological and climate effects. Arctic Oscillation (AO) is the dominant mode of atmospheric circulation variability in mid-to-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Its positive phase is featured by a low-pressure center in the Arctic region and high-pressure centers in the mid-latitude regions. Our results reveal a robust connection between the positive phase of AO in October and warm SSTAs in the NEP during winter. We identify two primary pathways through which the October AO influences the wintertime sea surface temperature (SST) warming in the NEP. Locally, a high-pressure anomaly over the NEP is associated with easterly wind anomalies to its southern flank, which diminish oceanic latent heat loss to the atmosphere, thus fostering the SST warming in the NEP. However, other locations of the high-pressure anomaly related to AO may not be favorable for the warming of the NEP. From a remote view, AO can impact the NEP SST through teleconnections due to increased precipitation in Greenland and decreased precipitation in East Asia, sustaining the high-pressure anomaly over the NEP and further bolstering the NEP warming.Temporally, Arctic Oscillation (AO) in October is closely linked to wintertime sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the mid-latitude Northeast Pacific (NEP) The AO-related anomalous ridge located over the NEP is favorable for the warming of SST locally Remotely, enhanced rainfall in Greenland and decreased rainfall near East Asia sustain the anomalous ridge over the NEP via teleconnection",2024,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES,129,19,,WOS:001319638900001,10.1029/2024JD041360,,#117,Chen 2024,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Marine heatwaves disrupt ecosystem structure and function via altered food webs and energy flux,"Gomes, DGE; Ruzicka, JJ; Crozier, LG; Huff, DD; Brodeur, RD; Stewart, JD","The prevalence and intensity of marine heatwaves is increasing globally, disrupting local environmental conditions. The individual and population-level impacts of prolonged heatwaves on marine species have recently been demonstrated, yet whole-ecosystem consequences remain unexplored. We leveraged time series abundance data of 361 taxa, grouped into 86 functional groups, from six long-term surveys, diet information from a new diet database, and previous modeling efforts, to build two food web networks using an extension of the popular Ecopath ecosystem modeling framework, Ecotran. We compare ecosystem models parameterized before and after the onset of recent marine heatwaves to evaluate the cascading effects on ecosystem structure and function in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. While the ecosystem-level contribution (prey) and demand (predators) of most functional groups changed following the heatwaves, gelatinous taxa experienced the largest transformations, underscored by the arrival of northward-expanding pyrosomes. We show altered trophic relationships and energy flux have potentially profound consequences for ecosystem structure and function, and raise concerns for populations of threatened and harvested species.This work leverages a new diet database and six long term monitoring efforts of 361 taxa to build comparable pre- and post-heatwave ecosystem models.

We showed that this extreme climate event diminished the power of multiple management strategies to resolve trade-offs between entanglement risk and fishery revenue, transforming near win-win to clear win-lose outcomes (for whales and fishers, respectively). While some actions were more cost-effective than others, there was no silver-bullet strategy to reduce the severity of these trade-offs.

Northeast Pacific marine heatwaves associated with high-latitude atmospheric blocking,"Niu, XF; Chen, YH; Le, CF","The Northeast Pacific Ocean (NEP) is one of the hotspots of marine heatwaves (MHWs) occurring in the global ocean. The causes of MHWs in this region have been widely investigated, but the physical processes underlying heatwaves and regional climate variability remain under debate. By analyzing interannual large-scale high-latitude atmospheric dynamics and oceanic physical conditions over the NEP, we show that winter-spring sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are strongly correlated with winter-spring atmospheric blocking events over Alaska. The occurrence of weaker westerly wind over the subarctic region over the NEP during the period of the blocking, accompanies a shallower vertical mixed layer, less southward horizontal Ekman transport, and higher SST in the upper NEP.

Investigation of the Kuroshio-coastal current interaction and marine heatwave trends in the coral habitats of Northeastern Taiwan,"Hsu, PC; Macagga, RAT; Lu, CY; Lo, DYJ","The continually rising concentration of the surface aqueous partial pressure of carbon dioxide has led to sustained ocean acidification and increased sea surface temperature (SST) in the coral habitats of northeastern Taiwan. Since 2016, this region has been experiencing intense marine heatwave (MHW) events, with the accumulated thermal stress reaching its peak between 2020 and 2022. Apart from the attributing factor of the increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, the Kuroshio (KC) path along the eastern coast of Taiwan has exhibited a westward tendency towards the coast of Taiwan from October to April. The westward and northward components of the KC's branch into the East China Sea (ECS) shelf have rapidly increased. The interplay between the KC and the northeastern Taiwan coastal countercurrent (NETCC) near the coral habitats has formed a counterclockwise circulation, which continues to show a westward trend. This has resulted in the influx of warmer waters into northeastern Taiwan. On another note, the pronounced negative phase of the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and La Nina conditions from 2020 to 2022 have further contributed to the increased SST, with the average MHW event accumulating to 172 days annually. The coral bleaching index, degree heating week (DHW), indicates that 2020 was historically the first year for this region to experience a DHW exceeding 8degree celsius-weeks, reaching an Alert Level 2 for bleaching, and 2022 saw even more severe conditions with an average of 12 days at this level. With a reduced number of typhoon incursions in recent years in northeastern Taiwan, and the absence of periodic cold waters to mitigate the heat, the future marine environment of the coral habitats in this region is of significant concern.",2024,,REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE,71,,,WOS:001186972000001,10.1016/j.rsma.2024.103431,,#124,Hsu 2024,"",""
Double intensification centers of summer marine heatwaves in the South China Sea associated with global warming,"Dong, TY; Liu, F; Dong, WJ; Ran, Q; Zhu, X; Hu, SJ; Yao, YL; Shi, H","Marine heatwaves (MHWs) in the South China Sea (SCS) have prolonged impacts on local ecosystems and economies, and accurate projection of MHWs under future global warming is crucial for the high-quality development of local society. The future change in the spatial pattern of MHWs, however, is not clear despite the well-known overall intensification of MHWs. Here we find that the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models can effectively capture the main distribution of observed SCS MHWs, showing a uniform distribution of frequency and a ""north high-south low"" distribution of mean intensity and cumulative intensity. However, it is worth noting that the simulated center of long MHW duration is shifted to the southern SCS compared to the central SCS in observations. Under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 1-2.6 (SSP126) scenario, the increase in MHW cumulative intensity exhibits a double-center structure in the northern coastal region and southern SCS. This is primarily attributed to the large increase in frequency and mean intensity in the north, and an increase in duration in the south. Both the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios project similar patterns of MHW intensification, but with larger magnitudes. The climatological distribution of the mixed layer depth (MLD), which is deeper in the south and shallower in the north, contributes to the spatial distribution of SCS MHW changes. The strong seasonal-mean sea surface temperature (SST) warming in the northern SCS, caused by enhanced solar radiation, also contributes to the intensification of MHW frequency and mean intensity in the northern region.",2024,,CLIMATE DYNAMICS,62,6,5593-5604,WOS:001209543800001,10.1007/s00382-024-07247-6,,#126,Dong 2024,"",attribution study; heatwave; physical drivers
Understanding the compound marine heatwave and low-chlorophyll extremes in the western Pacific Ocean,"Chen, QJ; Li, DL; Feng, JL; Zhao, L; Qi, JF; Yin, BS","The western Pacific Ocean is the global center for marine biodiversity, with high vulnerability to climate change. A better understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics and potential drivers of compound marine heatwaves (MHWs) and low-chlorophyll (LChl) extreme events is essential for the conservation and management of local marine organisms and ecosystems. Here, using daily satellite sea surface temperature and model-based chlorophyll concentration, we find that the climatological spatial distribution of MHW-LChl events in total days, duration, and intensity exhibits heterogeneous distributions. The southwest sections of the South China Sea (WSCS) and Indonesian Seas are the hotspots for compound events, with total MHW-LChl days that are more than 2.5 times higher than in the other sub-regions. Notably, there is a trend toward more frequent (> 4.2 d/decade), stronger (> 0.5), and longer-lasting (> 1.4 d/decade) MHW-LChl occurrences in the WSCS. The occurrence of compound MHW-LChl extremes exhibits remarkable seasonal differences, with the majority of these events transpiring during winter. Moreover, there are generally statistically significant increasing trends in MHW-LChl events for all properties on both seasonal and inter-annual timescales. Furthermore, we reveal that the total days of compound MHW-LChl extremes are strongly modulated by large-scale climate modes such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Dipole Mode Index.

"Effects of the Blob on settlement of spotted sand bass, <i>Paralabrax maculatofasciatus</i>, to Mission Bay, San Diego, CA","Basilio, A; Searcy, S; Thompson, AR","The West Coast of the United States experienced variable and sometimes highly unusual oceanographic conditions between 2012 and 2015. In particular, a warm mass of surface water known as the Pacific Warm Anomaly (popularly as ""TheBlob"") impinged on southern California in 2014, and warm-water conditions remained during the 2015 El Nino. We examine how this oceanographic variability affected delivery and individual characteristics of larval spotted sand bass (Paralabrax maculatofasciatus) to an estuarine nursery habitat in southern California. To quantify P. maculatofasciatus settlement patterns, three larval collectors were installed near the mouth of Mission Bay, San Diego CA, and retrieved weekly from June-October of 2012-2015. During 'Blob' conditions in 2014 and 2015, lower settlement rates of spotted sand bass were associated with higher sea surface temperature and lower wind speed, chlorophyll a (chl a) and upwelling. Overall, the number of settlers per day peaked at intermediate chl a values across weeks. Individual characteristics of larvae that settled in 2014-2015 were consistent with a poor feeding environment. Although settlers were longer in length in 2014-15, fish in these years had slower larval otolith growth, a longer larval duration, and a trend towards lower condition, traits that are often associated with lower survival and recruitment. This study suggests that future settlement and recruitment of P. maculatofasciatus and other fishes with similar life histories may be adversely affected in southern California if ocean temperatures continue to rise in the face of climate change.",2017,,PLOS ONE,12,11,,WOS:000416291900080,10.1371/journal.pone.0188449,,#128,Basilio 2017,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Unusually low euphausiid biomass during the warm years of 2014-2016 in the transition zone of the California Current,"Lavaniegos, BE; Jiménez-Herrera, M; Ambriz-Arreola, I","Euphausiids represent a significant part of the total zooplankton biomass and are a key link in the trophic web of the California Current System (CCS). During 2014-2016, the northeast Pacific experienced warming caused by two successive events, the Blob and the 2015-2016 El Nino, which affected the whole ecosystem. Here we present evidence for a strong impact of the 2014-2016 warm events on euphausiids in the Baja California region, namely two species (Euphausia pacifica and Nematoscelis difficilis) that are dominant in the CCS transition zone. Both species decreased approximately 95% in relation to the previous years (1999-2010). A similar decrease was observed for E. pacifica during the 1997-1998 El Nino, but the decrease in N. difficilis was higher in 2014-2016 and unprecedented during the 1997-2016 period. Biomass of the coastal species Nyctiphanes simplex showed negative anomalies during the Blob but not during the 2015-2016 El Nino. The tropical species Euphausia eximia and Euphausia recurva increased in biomass during the Blob in 2014 relative to the previous years, and even more during the 2015-2016 El Nino. The strong increase of E. eximia, E. recurva, and N. simplex during El Nino may have been due to upwelling activity in winter 2015-2016. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed to assess the relation between the euphausiid community and environmental variables. The most influential variables were temperature and chlorophyll, and to a lesser extent salinity. The subarctic E. pacifica showed covariance with chlorophyll while a set of tropical species did with thermohaline conditions. However, the variance accounted for was low (20% taking the first three axis).

We propose that these ecosystem changes, combined with recovering whale populations, contributed to the exacerbation of entanglements throughout the marine heatwave. In 2016, domoic acid contamination prompted an unprecedented delay in the opening of California's Dungeness crab fishery that inadvertently intensified the spatial overlap between whales and crab fishery gear.

Extreme and compound ocean events are key drivers of projected low pelagic fish biomass,"Le Grix, N; Cheung, WL; Reygondeau, G; Zscheischler, J; Frölicher, TL","Ocean extreme events, such as marine heatwaves, can have harmful impacts on marine ecosystems. Understanding the risks posed by such extreme events is key to develop strategies to predict and mitigate their effects. However, the underlying ocean conditions driving severe impacts on marine ecosystems are complex and often unknown as risks to marine ecosystems arise not only from hazards but also from the interactions between hazards, exposure and vulnerability. Marine ecosystems may not be impacted by extreme events in single drivers but rather by the compounding effects of moderate ocean anomalies. Here, we employ an ensemble climate-impact modeling approach that combines a global marine fish model with output from a large ensemble simulation of an Earth system model, to identify the key ocean ecosystem drivers associated with the most severe impacts on the total biomass of 326 pelagic fish species. We show that low net primary productivity is the most influential driver of extremely low fish biomass over 68% of the ocean area considered by the model, especially in the subtropics and the mid-latitudes, followed by high temperature and low oxygen in the eastern equatorial Pacific and the high latitudes. Severe biomass loss is generally driven by extreme anomalies in at least one ocean ecosystem driver, except in the tropics, where a combination of moderate ocean anomalies is sufficient to drive extreme impacts. Single moderate anomalies never drive extremely low fish biomass. Compound events with either moderate or extreme ocean conditions are a necessary condition for extremely low fish biomass over 78% of the global ocean, and compound events with at least one extreme variable are a necessary condition over 61% of the global ocean.

"Bering Sea marine heatwaves: Patterns, trends and connections with the Arctic","Carvalho, KS; Smith, TE; Wang, S","The conterminous marine system of the Bering Sea serves as an important connection between the Pacific and the Arctic. Surface water temperatures of the Northern Pacific have been rising over the past decades with associated changes in extremes: marine heatwaves (MHWs). This study aims to explore the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and occurrence mechanisms of MHWs in the Bering Sea. Our findings reveal that MHW metrics are above average in most parts of the Bering Sea, with the number of days being more than 50 a year. Frequencies of MHWs are relatively high in the western sectors while durations and intensities are high in the eastern and southern sectors of the Bering Sea. Increasing trends in the MHW days are noticed almost everywhere while similar increases in MHW intensities are found in the northern Bering Sea. In addition, Chukchi Sea ice concentrations show a negative correlation with heatwave frequencies and days while the Arctic Oscillation has no significant connection. Positive correlations are observed between Chukchi sea temperatures and Alaskan air temperatures, implying influences on the MHW frequencies and days. While the annual trends in the MHW frequencies and days peak over several periods, the latest decade (2010-2019) has seen the highest of both.

Furthermore, the Northeastern Tropical Pacific is affected by seasonal, interannual (El Nino - Southern Oscillation, marine heatwaves), and decadal variabilities (Pacific Decadal Oscillation). Here we analyzed a long-term (1973-2016) SST time-series from the Mazatlan coastal zone, at the eastern entrance of the Gulf of California (Mexico) to record the warming trend and to examine the effect of the 2013-2016 North Pacific SST positive anomaly. This SST time-series can be useful to better understand the interplay of surface water masses in the region (Tropical Surface Water, Gulf of California Water, and California Current Water) and their transport mechanisms. Variability analysis was focused on 2007-2016, for which a 10-year climatology was established. During this period, two La Nina and El Nino events, and a regional marine heatwave occurred in the Northeast Pacific. There was a significant positive correlation between the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) and SST anomalies. La Nina events caused large negative anomalies (up to 4 degrees C) in maximum SST, and El Nino events caused large positive anomalies (up to 7 degrees C) in the minimum SST. The 2013-2014 regional marine heatwave was preceded by a previously unreported anomalous regional warming at the entrance of the Gulf of California (2012-2013), which caused positive anomalies of 4 degrees C in minimum SST. Since then, each winter showed increasing minimum SST anomalies until reaching a 7 degrees C maximum in 2016. Minimum SST positive anomalies were caused by i) the inhibition of coastal upwelling of cold waters, and ii) a limited penetration of California Current cold waters. For the past 40 years, we estimated a mean warming trend of 0.57 +/- 0.01 degrees C per decade in the study area, which is larger than the global ocean increasing trend. This relatively fast warming rate could be caused by i) local effects caused by shallowness and coastal dynamics, ii) an increasing influence of warmer Tropical Surface Water transported by the Mexican Coastal Current, iii) the transport and upwelling of warmer waters from the Western Pacific Warm Pool during El Nino events, and iv) global warming, as increasing SST can induce stronger and longer-lasting thermoclines, especially in regions commonly affected by upwelling events. If this trend persists, a simple linear extrapolation would indicate that the mean SST from 1977 to 2100 would increase by 7 degrees C. This extrapolation should be taken with caution, but such an increase would have profound effects on the coastal ecosystems, so possible adaptation strategies merit urgent attention by scientists and coastal zone managers to dynamically adapt to coastal global warming and marine heatwaves. This methodology can be used in other coastal zones worldwide where enough field and satellite data are available.",2022,,PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY,202,,,WOS:000781369900004,10.1016/j.pocean.2022.102746,,#137,Sanchez-Cabeza 2022,"",heatwave; physical drivers; physical impact
The cause of an extreme sea surface warming in the midlatitude western North Pacific during 2012 summer,"Li, ZY; Wu, GF; Xu, C; Zhao, J; Wang, MQ; Sheng, J; Shen, Y; Zhu, XH","This study investigated an extreme sea surface warming in the midlatitude western North Pacific (MLWNP) during the summer of 2012. The 2012 extreme event was characterized by warm sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) extending from the East/Japan Sea to central North Pacific. The SSTA box-averaged over the MLWNP (130-180 degrees E, 33-50 degrees N) in 2012 ranked as the third warmest in recent four decades, which has caused intense marine heatwaves in this region. During the summer of 2012, a positive Indian Ocean Dipole event co-occurred with El Ni & ntilde;o, favoring anomalous moisture transport between the two basins that caused enhanced convection in the South China and Philippine Seas and western-to-central subtropical Pacific. The enhanced convective activities triggered two meridional atmospheric Rossby wave trains to form strong atmospheric blocking high-pressure systems in the MLWNP. This reduced the total cloud cover and surface wind speed, enhancing insolation and reducing the release of latent heat flux. In addition, the weakened wind strengthened the stratification and shoaled the mixed layer. As a result, the increased net heat flux into the ocean accompanied by a shallower mixed layer contributed to the upper ocean warming in the MLWNP. Meanwhile, the North Pacific was dominated by a negative phase of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), significantly contributing to warm SSTAs in the MLWNP in 2012. Consequently, the 2012 extreme warming in the MLWNP was the results of the combination of atmospheric Rossby waves and PDO. Our study highlighted the roles of high-frequency atmospheric teleconnection and low-frequency PDO in extreme sea surface warming in the MLWNP.",2024,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,11,,,WOS:001360307800001,10.3389/fmars.2024.1471446,,#139,Li 2024,"",framework; physical drivers; physical impact
Mechanisms by which marine heatwaves affect seabirds,"Piatt, JF; Arimitsu, ML; Thompson, SA; Suryan, R; Wilson, RP; Elliott, KH; Sydeman, WJ","Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are characterized by periods of extreme warming of local to basin-scale marine habitat. Effects of MHWs on some seabirds (e.g. mass die-offs) are well documented, but mechanisms by which seabirds respond to MHWs remain poorly understood. Following from a symposium at the 3(rd) World Seabird Conference, this Theme Section presents recent research to address this knowledge gap. Studies included here spanned one or more MHW event, at spatial scales from individual seabird colonies to large marine ecosystems in subtropical, temperate, and polar oceans, and over timespans from months to decades. The findings summarized herein indicate that MHWs can affect seabirds directly by creating physiological heat stress that affects behavior or survival, or indirectly by disrupting seabird food webs, largely by altering metabolic rates in ectothermic prey species, leading to effects on their associated predators and prey. Four main mechanisms by which MHWs affect seabirds are (1) habitat modification, (2) physiological forcing, (3) behavioral responses, and (4) ecological processes or species interactions. Most seabird species have experienced limited effects from MHWs to date, owing to ecological and behavioral adaptations that buffer MHW effects. However, the intensity and frequency of MHWs is increasing due to global warming, and more seabird species may have difficulty coping with future heatwave events. Also, MHW impacts can persist for years after a MHW ends, so consequences of recent or future MHWs could continue to unfold over time for many long-lived seabird species.",2024,,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,737,,1-8,WOS:001249746900009,10.3354/meps14625,,#140,Piatt 2024,"Rob Suryan (2025-10-12 06:29:20)(Select): I waiver on value of including reviews.

Record-breaking 2020 summer marine heatwaves in the western North Pacific,"Yao, YL; Wang, CZ; Wang, C","Record-breaking marine heatwaves (MHWs) occurred in the western North Pacific during the summer of 2020. These unprecedented MHWs were consistent with favorable large-scale conditions that are linked to an anom-alous western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH), resulting mainly from sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies across the tropical oceans. In addition, a moderate La Nin & SIM;a-like pattern was also conducive to transporting warm seawater to the western North Pacific. Mixed-layer heat budgets suggest that surface heat flux contributed to the SST anomaly in the western subtropical Pacific. In contrast, oceanic heat advection domi-nanted in the South China Sea and the western equatorial Pacific. Numerical model experiments indicated that the tropical Indian Ocean SST anomalies were responsible for the enhanced WNPSH. The increased zonal SST gradient across the tropical Pacific also played an important role. Inter-ocean interactions can modulate climate variability through ocean-atmospheric coupling and deserve more attention when predicting MHWs within the context of global warming. In addition, it is critical to consider MHWs as a powerful tool in detecting acute, intense thermal stress events in the coral bleaching pre-warning system.",2023,,DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY,209,,,WOS:001042245800001,10.1016/j.dsr2.2023.105288,,#145,Yao 2023,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Summer Marine Heatwaves in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension Region,"Du, YZ; Feng, M; Xu, ZH; Yin, BS; Hobday, AJ","During 1982-2021, the highest sea surface temperature (SST) variability over the North Pacific was in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE) region, with more intense marine heatwaves (MHWs), especially during summertime. In this study, we explored the evolution and driving factors of the strongest summer MHWs based on their cumulative intensity using satellite observations and reanalyzed model results. Strong summer MHWs in 1999, 2008, 2012, and 2016 were initiated and peaked around summer. The more recent summer MHW events in 2018, 2020, and 2021 appeared to be associated with intermittent MHW events in the previous winter that extended to boreal summer. Based on a mixed layer temperature budget analysis from March to their peaks in summer, MHWs in 1999, 2008, 2012, and 2016 were primarily driven by the air-sea heat flux anomalies, with anomalous shortwave radiation due to reduced cloud cover being the dominant factor. Summer MHWs in 2018, 2020, and 2021 were mainly contributed by the ocean memory of winter warming. The northward shift of the Kuroshio Extension axis, the northward intrusion of the anticyclonic eddies, and the decadal warming trend may contribute to the positive sea surface height anomalies and increased upper ocean heat content in the KOE to increase winter SST and precondition the summer MHWs. Understanding MHW variability and the underlying mechanisms will help manage the marine ecosystem of the KOE region, as well as predict climate change impacts.",2022,,REMOTE SENSING,14,13,,WOS:000825624400001,10.3390/rs14132980,,#148,Du 2022,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Marine heatwave events strengthen the intensity of tropical cyclones,"Choi, HY; Park, MS; Kim, HS; Lee, S","Marine heatwaves become more frequent and stronger due to global warming. It is necessary to clarify how and by which process marine heatwaves affect marine weather systems. Here, we examine how marine heatwaves strengthen tropical cyclones. We analyze 128 tropical cyclones that intensified with marine heatwaves and 184 tropical cyclones that intensified without marine heatwaves over the western North Pacific and Atlantic. Marine heatwaves finally lead to a maximum intensity of 35.4% stronger (106.72 kts) tropical cyclone. Notably, satellite data reveal that marine heatwaves are associated with precipitation-richer tropical cyclone conditions despite similar tropical cyclone intensities. Due to the increased latent heat flux during marine heatwaves, intensified precipitation near the tropical cyclone center contributes to the intensification process. This study provides insights into how more frequent marine heatwaves by global warming impact tropical cyclones.Tropical cyclones that interact with marine heatwaves increase their intensity by 35.4% in the western North Pacific and North Atlantic basin as a result of increased latent heat flux and higher precipitation, according to an analysis of tropical cyclone data between 1982 and 2019.",2024,,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,5,1,,WOS:001157679000002,10.1038/s43247-024-01239-4,,#151,Choi 2024,"",GLOBAL; heatwave; physical impact
An Optimal Precursor of Northeast Pacific Marine Heatwaves and Central Pacific El Nino Events,"Capotondi, A; Newman, M; Xu, T; Di Lorenzo, E","The intensity of Northeast Pacific marine heatwaves (MHWs) has been related to local stochastic atmospheric forcing with limited predictability, but their evolution and persistence may be controlled by large-scale climate influences. A Linear Inverse Model containing both sea surface temperature and sea surface height (SSH) anomalies is used to identify the ""optimal"" conditions for observed Northeast Pacific MHW events that developed two-to-four seasons later. These optimal initial conditions include SSH anomalies that are responsible for most of the MHW growth, suggesting the relevance of subsurface ocean dynamics.

Hotspots and drivers of compound marine heatwaves and low net primary production extremes,"Le Grix, N; Zscheischler, J; Rodgers, KB; Yamaguchi, R; Frölicher, TL","Extreme events can severely impact marine organisms and ecosystems. Of particular concern are multivariate compound events, namely when conditions are simultaneously extreme for multiple ocean ecosystem stressors. In 2013-2015 for example, an extensive marine heatwave (MHW), known as the Blob, co-occurred locally with extremely low net primary productivity (NPPX) and negatively impacted marine life in the northeast Pacific. Yet, little is known about the characteristics and drivers of such multivariate compound MHW-NPPX events. Using five different satellite-derived net primary productivity (NPP) estimates and large-ensemble-simulation output of two widely used and comprehensive Earth system models, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) ESM2M-LE and Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2-LE), we assess the present-day distribution of compound MHW-NPPX events and investigate their potential drivers on the global scale. The satellite-based estimates and both models reveal hotspots of frequent compound events in the center of the equatorial Pacific and in the subtropical Indian Ocean, where their occurrence is at least 3 times higher (more than 10 d yr-1) than if MHWs (temperature above the seasonally varying 90th-percentile threshold) and NPPX events (NPP below the seasonally varying 10th-percentile threshold) were to occur independently. However, the models show disparities in the northern high latitudes, where compound events are rare in the satellite-based estimates and GFDL ESM2M-LE (less than 3 d yr-1) but relatively frequent in CESM2-LE. In the Southern Ocean south of 60(?)degrees S, low agreement between the observation-based estimates makes it difficult to determine which of the two models better simulates MHW-NPPX events. The frequency patterns can be explained by the drivers of compound events, which vary among the two models and phytoplankton types. In the low latitudes, MHWs are associated with enhanced nutrient limitation on phytoplankton growth, which results in frequent compound MHW-NPPX events in both models. In the high latitudes, NPPX events in GFDL ESM2M-LE are driven by enhanced light limitation, which rarely co-occurs with MHWs, resulting in rare compound events. In contrast, in CESM2-LE, NPPX events in the high latitudes are driven by reduced nutrient supply that often co-occurs with MHWs, moderates phytoplankton growth, and causes biomass to decrease. Compound MHW-NPPX events are associated with a relative shift towards larger phytoplankton in most regions, except in the eastern equatorial Pacific in both models, as well as in the northern high latitudes and between 35 and 50(?)degrees S in CESM2-LE, where the models suggest a shift towards smaller phytoplankton, with potential repercussions on marine ecosystems. Overall, our analysis reveals that the likelihood of compound MHW-NPPX events is contingent on model representation of the factors limiting phytoplankton production. This identifies an important need for improved process understanding in Earth system models used for predicting and projecting compound MHW-NPPX events and their impacts.",2022,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,19,24,5807-5835,WOS:000899757600001,10.5194/bg-19-5807-2022,,#153,LeGrix 2022,KAREN HUNTER (2025-08-26 04:06:24)(Select): global but sounds possible to extract NP findings.; ,GLOBAL; compound event

Characteristics of Marine Heatwaves in the Japan/East Sea,"Wang, DQ; Xu, TF; Fang, GH; Jiang, SM; Wang, GL; Wei, ZX; Wang, YG","Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged discrete events of anomalously warm seawater observed around the world. The occurrence of MHWs in the Japan/East Sea (JES), a middle latitude marginal sea with abundant aquatic resources, has severe impacts on marine ecosystems and human society. We used satellite remote sensing products spanning 1982-2020 to investigate the mean states and variations of JES MHWs. The results show that the JES MHWs occurred twice per year. More than 40% of the MHWs were shorter than the mean duration of 12.6 days and weaker than the mean intensity of 2.4 degrees C. Frequent MHWs were observed in August, while high mean intensities were observed in winter and spring in the western JES. In recent years, the area's averaged yearly sum of MHW intensity in the JES has increased dramatically, with a positive trend of 29.62 degrees C days per decade-over twice the average global trend (12.37 degrees C days per decade), which is further confirmed by its first empirical orthogonal function mode.

Controlling factors of large-scale harmful algal blooms with <i>Karenia selliformis</i> after record-breaking marine heatwaves,"Takagi, S; Kuroda, H; Hasegawa, N; Watanabe, T; Unuma, T; Taniuchi, Y; Yokota, T; Izumida, D; Nakagawa, T; Kurokawa, T; Azumaya, T","Unprecedented, large-scale harmful algal blooms (HABs) dominated by Karenia selliformis occurred off the southeastern coast of Hokkaido, Japan, from late September to early November 2021, about a month after intense and extensive marine heatwaves (MHWs) had subsided. The aims of the present study were to understand the mechanism of development, maintenance, and decay of the HABs as well as to investigate the effect of the MHWs on the HABs. We developed a one-dimensional, lower trophic-level ecosystem model (NEMURO+) to simulate the HABs. The model successfully simulated the 2021 HABs and indicated that their development, maintenance, and decay were controlled primarily by changes of water temperature. Nitrate supply from subsurface layers by seasonal vertical diffusion in autumn also helped to maintain the HABs. Vertical diffusion following MHWs in 2021 contributed to the long duration of the preferred temperature for K. selliformis and the occurrence of pre-bloom of K. selliformis, resulting in preconditioning and accelerating the HABs. However, simulations for normal years (i.e., the climatological mean during 2003-2018) showed that HABs could have occurred, even in the absence of MHWs. The simulations indicated that massive blooms of other phytoplankton species (e.g., diatoms) would not have occurred in 2021, even in the absence of a K. selliformis bloom. The implication was that the HABs in 2021 were the species-specific responses of K. selliformis. The proposed mechanism of the HABs was peculiar to our study area and differed from that previously reported for other K. selliformis blooms. Specifically, the preferred temperature for the HABs of K. selliformis was clearly lower than the previously reported preferred temperature of K. selliformis; thus, the physiological characteristics of the K. selliformis that bloomed in our study area differed from those of other K. selliformis strains.

Here, we reviewed the traits of published literature that has used field, laboratory, and modelling approaches to examine the biotic effects of MHWs, and highlight some of the key findings. Since its first use in this context in 2013, the term ""marine heatwave"" has generally been used in field-based literature primarily documenting changes in abundance, biodiversity, species distributions, and mortality, primarily in fish and molluscs. Research is increasingly also conducted in laboratory settings, with these investigations focussing on changes in mechanistic processes such as growth and biochemical responses, often in smaller or less motile organisms including seagrasses, algae, molluscs, and crustaceans. Given their different applications, these complementary approaches will provide a more complete understanding when used to consider the same taxonomic groups. Moreover, those manipulating MHWs in laboratory experiments could benefit from the consideration of a range of MHW traits (intensity, duration, and their combination), for species in both isolation and combination, and in the presence of additional abiotic stressors.

Relationship between surface dissolved iron inventories and net community production during a marine heatwave in the subarctic northeast Pacific,"Taves, RC; Janssen, DJ; Peña, MA; Ross, ARS; Simpson, KG; Crawford, WR; Cullen, JT","From winter 2013-14 to the end of 2015-16, a high pressure atmospheric system induced elevated sea surface temperatures in the offshore subarctic northeast Pacific, resulting in a marine heatwave. Increased stratification due to the heatwave resulted in shoaling of the winter mixed layer and a decrease in nutrient re-supply to the euphotic zone. Here, we investigate relationships between dissolved iron (dFe) and macronutrients, net community production (NCP), (micro)nutrient uptake ratios, and phytoplankton community composition in the winter and summer from 2012 to 2015 to gain insight into coupled biogeochemical responses to the heatwave. Our investigation highlights the importance of external dFe supply during marine heatwave events, as a more shallow mixed layer reduces the transport of essential (micro)macronutrients to the surface layer. We conclude that recycled dFe did not contribute to NCP in 2014, but rather the vertical displacement of dFe rich water unrelated to mixed layer deepening played a major role. In 2015, such transport was not detected, resulting in abnormally low dFe and shift toward higher biomass of pico- and nano-phytoplankton size-classes.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS,24,9,1460-1473,WOS:000790832100001,10.1039/d2em00021k,,#167,Taves 2022,"",heatwave; physical impact

In addition, 2022 was also recorded as a year of many extreme events throughout Asia, such as summer floods in China and Pakistan, droughts and extreme heat in Europe, raising the question of whether they were caused by a 'triple-dip' La Nina, which has persisted since September 2020. Here we examine the key local and remote processes that led to the 2022 MHWs in the ECS using mixed-layer heat budget analysis. During the onset of the MHWs, a salinity-stratified shallow mixed-layer due to the large river discharge from the Yangtze-Huaihe River floods in June created favorable conditions for warm ocean temperature in the ECS. Simultaneously, an anomalous anticyclone maintained by the stationary Rossby wave, which is generated by vorticity forcings in mid-latitudes and thermal forcing in Pakistan, settled in the corresponding region and led to the long-lasting MHWs until Typhoon Hinnamnor began to dissipate the wave in early September.

Water temperature variability in the Coos Estuary and its potential link to eelgrass loss,"Jarrin, MJM; Sutherland, DA; Helms, AR","Subtidal water temperatures in estuaries influence where organisms can survive and are determined by oceanic, atmospheric and riverine heat fluxes, modulated by the distinct geometry and bathymetry of the system.

The arrival of a marine heatwave in September 2014 increased water temperature in the greater Pacific Northwest region until March 2015, and again from July to August 2015. Additionally, in 2014-2016, the Equatorial Pacific showed increased temperatures due to El Nino events. In the Coos Estuary, this warming was observed at all the water quality stations, producing more than 100 days with temperatures at least 1.5 degrees C warmer than normal, and notably, a higher prevalence during Fall and Winter seasons. Larger temperature variations occurred at shallower stations located further away from the mouth of the estuary, changing the along-estuary temperature gradient and potentially the advection of heat through the estuary. After the onset of these increased temperatures, eelgrass declined sharply, but only in certain stations in the shallow estuary South Slough and has not yet returned to long term average values.

"The effect of the 2013-2016 high temperature anomaly in the subarctic Northeast Pacific (the ""Blob"") on net community production","Yang, B; Emerson, SR; Peña, MA","A large anomalously warm water patch (the ""Blob"") appeared in the NE Pacific Ocean in the winter of 2013-2014 and persisted through 2016 causing strong positive upper ocean temperature anomalies at Ocean Station Papa (OSP, 50 degrees N, 145 degrees W). The effect of the temperature anomalies on annual net community production (ANCP) was determined by upper ocean chemical mass balances of O-2 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) using data from a profiling float and a surface mooring. Year-round oxygen mass balance in the upper ocean (0 to 91-111 m) indicates that ANCP decreased after the first year when warmer water invaded this area and then returned to the ""preBlob"" value (2.4, 0.8, 2.1, and 1.6 mol Cm-2 yr(-1) from 2012 to 2016, with a mean value of 1.7 +/- 0.7 mol Cm(-2)yr(-1) ). ANCP determined from the DIC mass balance has a mean value that is similar within the errors as that from the 02 mass balance but without a significant trend (2.0, 2.1, 2.6, and 3.0 mol Cm-2 yr(-1) with a mean value of 2.4 +/- 0.6 mol Cm(-2)yr(-1) ). This is likely due to differences in the air-sea gas exchange, which is a major term for both mass balances. Oxygen has a residence time with respect to gas exchange of about 1 month while the CO2 gas exchange response time is more like a year. Therefore the biologically induced oxygen saturation anomaly responds fast enough to record annual changes, whereas that for CO(2 )does not. Phytoplankton pigment analysis from the upper ocean shows lower chlorophyll a concentrations and changes in plankton community composition (greater relative abundance of picoplankton) in the year after the warm water patch entered the area than in previous and subsequent years. Our analysis of multiple physical and biological processes that may have caused the ANCP decrease after warm water entered the area suggests that it was most likely due to the temperature-induced changes in biological processes.",2018,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,15,21,6747-6759,WOS:000450004900002,10.5194/bg-15-6747-2018,,#172,Yang 2018,"",ecosystem response; heatwave

Most birds were severely emaciated and, so far, no evidence for anything other than starvation was found to explain this mass mortality. Three-quarters of murres were found in the Gulf of Alaska and the remainder along the West Coast. Studies show that only a fraction of birds that die at sea typically wash ashore, and we estimate that total mortality approached 1 million birds. About two-thirds of murres killed were adults, a substantial blow to breeding populations. Additionally, 22 complete reproductive failures were observed at multiple colonies region-wide during (2015) and after (2016-2017) the mass mortality event. Die-offs and breeding failures occur sporadically in murres, but the magnitude, duration and spatial extent of this die-off, associated with multi-colony and multi-year reproductive failures, is unprecedented and astonishing. These events cooccurred with the most powerful marine heatwave on record that persisted through 2014-2016 and created an enormous volume of ocean water (the ""Blob"") from California to Alaska with temperatures that exceeded average by 2-3 standard deviations. Other studies indicate that this prolonged heatwave reduced phytoplankton biomass and restructured zooplankton communities in favor of lower-calorie species, while it simultaneously increased metabolically driven food demands of ectothermic forage fish. In response, forage fish quality and quantity diminished. Similarly, large ectothermic groundfish were thought to have increased their demand for forage fish, resulting in greater top-predator demands for diminished forage fish resources. We hypothesize that these bottom-up and top-down forces created an ""ectothermic vise"" on forage species leading to their system-wide scarcity and resulting in mass mortality of murres and many other fish, bird and mammal species in the region during 2014-2017.",2020,,PLOS ONE,15,1,,WOS:000534368000018,10.1371/journal.pone.0226087,,#175,Piatt 2020,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
"PREDATOR DISTURBANCE CONTRIBUTED TO COMMON MURRE <i>URIA AALGE</i> BREEDING FAILURES IN COOK INLET, ALASKA, FOLLOWING THE 2014-2016 PACIFIC MARINE HEATWAVE","Marsteller, CE; Arimitsu, ML; Schoen, SK; Stark, SB; Piatt, JF","The 2014-2016 Pacific marine heatwave caused unprecedented die-offs and multi-year reproductive failures for Common Murres Uria aalge along the west coast of North America. Lingering impacts, such as declines in colony attendance and productivity, have persisted at some colonies following the heatwave and are attributed largely to changes in prey availability and quality. Here, we present evidence of an additional, top-down mechanism contributing to Common Murre breeding failures on Gull Island (Alaska): disturbance of nesting birds by aerial predators and associated egg depredation. We collected time-lapse images over five murre breeding seasons (2016-2020) on Gull Island to document the frequency, duration, and intensity of disturbances caused by aerial predators, as well as to quantify disturbance-associated egg depredation. To identify seasonal and inter-annual variability of disturbances, we calculated a daily disturbance index and compared years using generalized additive models. In all years, Bald Eagles Haliaeetus leucocephalus were the primary cause of disturbance, which led to periods of prolonged colony abandonment by murres and facilitated high levels of murre egg depredation by Glaucous-winged Gulls Larus glaucescens and Herring Gulls L. argentatus. We found that the seasonality of disturbance was an important factor in determining egg depredation rates. In years when disturbance levels were high and persisted later in the season, the colony experienced complete breeding failures due to disturbance-associated egg depredation. Our study revealed that the response of nesting murres to a strong environmental perturbation, such as the Pacific marine heatwave, can be complex and involve multiple stressors from both bottom-up and top-down factors.",2024,,MARINE ORNITHOLOGY,52,1,129-139,WOS:001232001800010,,,#176,Marsteller 2024,"",compound event; ecosystem response; heatwave
Impact of the reemergence of North Pacific subtropical mode water on the multi-year modulation of marine heatwaves in the North Pacific Ocean during winter and early spring,"Tak, YJ; Song, H; Cho, YK","Marine heatwaves (MHWs), which are characterized by extremely warm water, can harm the marine ecosystem and fishing industry; improving the prediction of such events could reduce their harmful impact. In this study, we examined MHWs occurring in the North Pacific in winter/early spring, and their relationship with North Pacific subtropical mode water (STMW), based on the data analysis and numerical experiments. The time-lagged correlation between the cumulative intensity of MHWs and volume of STMW in March of each year suggests that STMW can modulate MHWs for up to three years after its formation. A patch of statistically significant negative correlation initially appeared in the formation region of the STMW but was found to the east of it near the Transition Zone Chlorophyll Front (TZCF) after one year. This patch stagnated near this remote site in the second winter and early spring. Passive tracer experiments using a numerical model indicate that the STMW, formed near the Kuroshio Extension in March, moves to the east underneath the mixed layer and is entrained to the surface in the following winter while altering the properties of STMW. The STMW reemerges in the second winter, after stagnating under the mixed layer near the TZCF. This suggests that the reemergence of STMW can suppress MHWs in the North Pacific during winter and early spring by reducing the sea surface temperature; if the volume of STMW is anomalously low, there is a greater likelihood of the occurrence of MHWs near the TZCF in the following two winters and early springs. Our results indicate that understanding STMW formation is crucial for predicting MHWs in the North Pacific Ocean during winter and early spring.",2021,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,16,7,,WOS:000670418300001,10.1088/1748-9326/ac0cad,,#177,Tak 2021,"",GLOBAL; heatwave; physical drivers
"Aerial survey perspectives on humpback whale resiliency in Maui Nui, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, in the face of an unprecedented North Pacific marine warming event","Mobley, JR; Deakos, MH; Pack, AA; Bortolotto, GA","After decades of population growth, the central stock of the North Pacific population of humpback whales, known as the HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai Distinct Population Segment (HDPS), was delisted from its endangered status in 2016. At that time, however, an unprecedented heating event, the Pacific Marine Heatwave (PMH) was already underway. The PMH coincided with reports of major declines of sightings of humpback whales, including calves of the year, on both the Hawaiian wintering grounds and the feeding grounds of Southeast Alaska. To examine the resiliency of the HDPS, we conducted aerial surveys of the high-density Maui Nui region immediately following the PMH event in 2019 and 2020, using distance sampling methods identical to those used in an earlier series (1993-2003). Results showed whale densities at or above those seen earlier, with mean density for 2020 highest overall. Crude birth rates (percent groups containing a calf) were similarly comparable to those recorded in the earlier series, with an increase from 2019 to 2020.

"Summer marine heatwaves in the South China Sea: Trend, variability and possible causes","Tan, HJ; Cai, RS; Wu, RG","Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been frequently observed worldwide, causing devastating impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems, but the trend of MHWs is still unclear in the South China Sea (SCS). Here, the long-term trend and inter-annual variability of the summer SCS MHW events are investigated based on the high-resolution daily satellite data. The results revealed remarkable increases in the duration, intensity, coverage, and severity during 1982-2019, indicating that the SCS MHW events have become more frequent, intense, extensive, and serious. The probability ratio of SCS MHW events is four times during the 2010s of that during the 1980s. The increasing trend can be largely attributed to the long-term increase in the mean SCS temperature. The inter-annual variability of the SCS MHWs is linked closely to the El Nino and Southern Oscillation, with more/less MHW events occurring during the following summer after the El Nino/La Nina events. A diagnosis of synoptic-scale heat budget suggests that the extreme SCS warming can be explained by the combined effects of positive surface heat flux largely due to the enhanced shortwave radiation and convergence of oceanic advection in association with an anomalous upper-ocean anticyclone. The effect of surface heat flux seems to be predominant over the large spatial coverage, whereas oceanic heat transport is also important in some specific regions. The large-scale anticyclonic circulation anomalies over the northwestern Pacific accompanying the westward-extending western Pacific subtropical high during the El Nino decay summers play an essential role in the building-up and persistence of the extreme warming, which has important implications for the prediction of the SCS MHWs.",2022,,ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH,13,3,323-332,WOS:000802050300003,10.1016/j.accre.2022.04.003,,#179,Tan 2022,"",heatwave; physical drivers

Structure, functioning, and resilience, however, can vary geographically, depending on species composition, local oceanographic forcing, and other pressures from human activities and use. Understanding ecological responses to environmental change and predicting changes in the structure and functioning of whole ecosystems require large-scale, long-term studies, yet most studies trade spatial extent for temporal duration. We address this shortfall by integrating multiple long-term kelp forest monitoring datasets to evaluate biogeographic patterns and rates of change of key functional groups (FG) along the west coast of North America. Analysis of data from 469 sites spanning Alaska, USA, to Baja California, Mexico, and 373 species (assigned to 18 FG) reveals regional variation in responses to both long-term (2006-2016) change and a recent marine heatwave (2014-2016) associated with two atmospheric and oceanographic anomalies, the ""Blob"" and extreme El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Canopy-forming kelps appeared most sensitive to warming throughout their range. Other FGs varied in their responses among trophic levels, ecoregions, and in their sensitivity to heatwaves. Changes in community structure were most evident within the southern and northern California ecoregions, while communities in the center of the range were more resilient. We report a poleward shift in abundance of some key FGs. These results reveal major, ongoing region-wide changes in productive coastal marine ecosystems in response to large-scale climate variability, and the potential loss of foundation species. In particular, our results suggest that coastal communities that are dependent on kelp forests will be more impacted in the southern portion of the California Current region, highlighting the urgency of implementing adaptive strategies to sustain livelihoods and ensure food security.

Combined oceanic and atmospheric forcing of the 2013/14 marine heatwave in the northeast Pacific,"Chen, HH; Wang, YT; Xiu, P; Yu, Y; Ma, WT; Chai, F","An unprecedented warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly event, namely, the Blob, occurred in the northeast Pacific during the winter (October-January) of 2013/2014, causing substantial economic and ecological impacts. Here, we explore the driving forces of the Blob from both atmospheric and oceanic perspectives and show that the Blob primarily resulted from weak wintertime cooling due to the reduced air-sea heat flux transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere and the reduced horizontal advection of cold water in the upper ocean. Both mechanisms were attributed to an anomalous high-pressure system over the study region. Specifically, the anomalous air-sea heat flux, which was dominated by turbulent heat flux anomalies, was mainly induced by the increased air temperature (i.e., with a contribution of approximately 70%) and the weakened wind speed associated with the high-pressure system. The reduced horizontal heat advection was mainly due to the weakened winds acting on the ocean temperature meridional gradient. Using a regional ocean numerical model with different experimental runs, we evaluated the contributions of air temperature and wind drivers to the Blob at both the surface and subsurface of the ocean. The Blob was absent when the model was forced by climatology-air-temperature. Both the SST and integrated ocean heat content (OHC, 0-150 m) decreased, and the mixed layer depth (MLD) was deeper than that in the control run forced by real atmospheric conditions. In the climatology-winds experiment, obvious warm anomalies still existed, which were similar to but weaker than the control run. The SST (OHC) and MLD values in the climatology-winds run were between those of the climatology-air-temperature run and the control run. Compared to former studies that attribute the formation of the Blob to an anomalous air-sea heat flux and horizontal advection mainly induced by reduced winds, our study demonstrates that anomalous warm air temperatures played a more important role in its formation.",2023,,NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE,6,1,,WOS:000920156900001,10.1038/s41612-023-00327-0,,#186,Chen 2023,"",heatwave; physical drivers

Marine heatwaves in the Western North Pacific Region: Historical characteristics and future projections,"Sun, WJ; Yin, LJ; Pei, YF; Shen, C; Yang, YF; Ji, JL; Yang, JS; Dong, CM","This study investigates the historical characteristics and future trends of marine heatwaves (MHWs) in the Western North Pacific (WNP) region. During the historical period from 1982 to 2014, the WNP region experiences an average MHW frequency of 0.89 +/- 0.18 count/year. These events have an average duration of 8.64 +/- 1.39 days/count. Annually, the cumulative MHW days amount to 7.76 +/- 2.23 days, with an accumulated intensity of 15.73 +/- 6.43 degrees C days. The maximum intensity recorded during this period reaches 2.04 +/- 0.54 degrees C, while the average intensity stands at 1.74 +/- 0.48 degrees C/count. In the evaluation of 14 CMIP6 models, five optimal models, namely GFDL-ESM4, EC-Earth3-Veg, EC-Earth3, BCC-CSM2-MR, and MRI-ESM2-0, are selected for simulating future MHWs. Based on the simulation results of these five models under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios for the future period (2015-2100), it is found that under the SSP2-4.5, the frequency of MHWs is slightly higher compared to the SSP5-8.5. However, under the SSP5-8.5, MHWs exhibit higher accumulated intensity, maximum intensity, and average intensity, with a predominance of high-intensity MHWs in the Kuroshio Extension region. The occurrence area ratio in the future is significantly larger than in the historical period. Moreover, MHWs intensity displays a seasonal variation, with stronger during summer and weaker during winter.

Nutrient limitation dampens the response of a harmful algae to a marine heatwave in an upwelling system,"Fischer, AD; Houliez, E; Bill, BD; Kavanaugh, MT; Alin, SR; Collins, AU; Kudela, RM; Moore, SK","Harmful algal blooms caused by toxin-producing species of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia have been linked to anomalously warm ocean conditions in the Northern California Current System. This study compares summertime concentrations of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and the toxin they produce, domoic acid, during a marine heatwave year (2019) and a climatologically neutral year (2021). An Imaging FlowCytobot was installed on a fishery survey vessel alongside environmental sensors to continuously sample phytoplankton and oceanographic parameters. This was paired with targeted manual sample collections for nutrients, chlorophyll, and domoic acid. Accumulations of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were associated with upwelling zones and established hotspot regions: the Juan de Fuca Eddy, Heceta Bank, and Trinidad Head. Overall, however, Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and domoic acid concentrations were low during both summers and appear to have been limited by nitrate. Nutrient availability may therefore modulate the response of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. to warm anomalies. Comparison of these results with 2015, another marine heatwave year but one that produced record concentrations of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and domoic acid, suggests that the timing of marine heatwave conditions in the nearshore relative to seasonal upwelling plays a key role in determining whether a Pseudo-nitzschia spp. harmful algal bloom will occur.",2024,,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,,,,WOS:001256572800001,10.1002/lno.12604,,#193,Fischer 2024,"",heatwave
"A Global, Multiproduct Analysis of Coastal Marine Heatwaves: Distribution, Characteristics, and Long-Term Trends","Marin, M; Feng, M; Phillips, HE; Bindoff, NL","Major marine heatwave (MHW) events have caused catastrophic impacts on coastal marine ecosystems. However, to date there has not been a global assessment of MHWs in coastal areas where rich marine ecosystems are at risk. Here, we combine four satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) products to quantify the distribution, characteristics, and decadal trend of coastal MHWs, using an ensemble approach. Hotspots of MHW stress, defined as yearly cumulative intensity, were found to be concentrated in mid latitude coasts like the Mediterranean Sea, Japan Sea, and Tasman Sea, as well as the north-eastern coast of the United States. We found a global increase in coastal MHW frequency and duration during the past 25 years by 1-2 events per decade and 5-10 days per decade, respectively, with regional distribution closely related to decadal climate variability. Increases in frequency and duration of MHWs has led to large increases of cumulative intensity and yearly cumulative intensity, particularly in mid-latitudes and hotspot regions. Long-term changes in mean SST were the main driver of the observed trends of coastal MHWs, while internal variability was important for explaining local decreases in MHW metrics such as along the south-eastern Pacific coast. MHW average metrics and trends were consistent across all four products used in this analysis, giving high confidence in the results. However, important differences between products were observed for MHW mean intensity, which was well correlated to SST variability, suggesting sensitivity of this metric to the specific SST data set and demonstrating a need for an ensemble approach to MHW analysis.",2021,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,126,2,,WOS:000624429800055,10.1029/2020JC016708,,#194,Marin 2021,"",GLOBAL; heatwave

The contributions of the frequency and mean projection area to the total projection area were further investigated from the four categories of MHWs. The results showed that for moderate MHWs, frequency contributes more than the mean projection area to the increase in projection area; however, for strong, severe, and extreme MHWs, the mean projection area contributes much more than frequency. Due to the increased moving distance, the projected area change of the extreme MHW dominates the increase in the total projected area.

Bottom marine heatwaves along the continental shelves of North America,"Amaya, DJ; Jacox, MG; Alexander, MA; Scott, JD; Deser, C; Capotondi, A; Phillips, AS","Recently, there has been substantial effort to understand the fundamental characteristics of warm ocean temperature extremes-known as marine heatwaves (MHWs). However, MHW research has primarily focused on the surface signature of these events. While surface MHWs (SMHW) can have dramatic impacts on marine ecosystems, extreme warming along the seafloor can also have significant biological outcomes. In this study, we use a high-resolution (similar to 8km) ocean reanalysis to broadly assess bottom marine heatwaves (BMHW) along the continental shelves of North America. We find that BMHW intensity and duration varies strongly with bottom depth, with typical intensities ranging from similar to 0.5 degrees C-3 degrees C. Further, BMHWs can be more intense and persist longer than SMHWs. While BMHWs and SMHWs often co-occur, BMHWs can also exist without a SMHW. Deeper regions in which the mixed layer does not typically reach the seafloor exhibit less synchronicity between BMHWs and SMHWs.The authors investigate marine heatwaves on the ocean bottom in the shallow waters surrounding North America.

Extensive Marine Heatwaves at the Sea Surface in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean in Summer 2021,"Kuroda, H; Setou, T","In July-August 2021, intense marine heatwaves (MHWs) occurred at the sea surface over extensive areas of the northwestern Pacific Ocean, including the entire Sea of Japan and part of the Sea of Okhotsk. In extent and intensity, these MHWs were the largest since 1982, when satellite measurements of global sea surface temperatures started. The MHWs in summer 2021 were observed at the sea surface and occurred concomitantly with a stable shallow oceanic surface boundary layer. The distribution of the MHWs was strongly related to heat fluxes at the sea surface, indicating that the MHWs were generated mainly by atmospheric forcing. The MHWs started to develop after around 10 July, concurrent with an extreme northward shift of the atmospheric westerly jet. The MHWs developed rapidly under an atmospheric high-pressure system near the sea surface, associated with a northwestward expansion of the North Pacific Subtropical High. The MHWs exhibited peaks around 30 July to 1 August. Subsequently, following the southward displacement of the westerly jet, the MHWs weakened and then shrank abruptly, synchronously with rapid deepening of the oceanic surface boundary layer.

Oceanographic data confirm a persistent warm-water anomaly in 2015-2016 in Glacier Bay, months later than the PMH was documented in the North Pacific. We assessed changes in demographic parameters pre- and post-PMH using whale and calf counts and multi-state closed population capture-recapture models. Non-calf abundance decreased by 56% between 2013 and 2018, followed by increases in 2019-2020. The predicted proportion of females in the population declined in 2015-2017 (0.40-0.44).

Calf survival dropped tenfold beginning with calves born in 2013 (0.396-0.032) and midsummer calf losses occurred at an unprecedented rate starting in 2014. Non-calf survival declined from 0.982 pre-PMH to 0.899 post-PMH, lower than any value reported for this species.

We examined the influence of two major events on mussel (Mytilus trossulus) abundance in the northern Gulf of Alaska: the recent Pacific marine heatwave (PMH, 2014-2016) and an outbreak of sea star wasting (SSW). We investigated how mussel abundance changed since the onset of SSW and whether the density of predatory sea stars or PMH-related temperature metrics explain variation in mussel abundance. Sea stars and mussels were surveyed since 2005 approximately annually in four regions of the northern Gulf of Alaska: Katmai (KATM), Kachemak Bay (KBAY), Kenai Fjords (KEFJ) and western Prince William Sound (WPWS). Mussel percent cover in the mid-intertidal increased 1-3 years after declines in sea stars at all regions and in the low-intertidal at KATM, KBAY, and KEFJ, but not at WPWS. After the onset of SSW, large (>= 20 mm length) mussel density and mussel bed width increased at KATM but not the other regions. Total mussel densities, including recruits, did not differ before and after the onset of SSW. The total number of sea stars significantly explained variation in mussel metrics, but the proportions of the three sea star species examined did not. We did not find strong evidence for direct effects of temperature on mussels. The effects of the PMH and the SSW outbreak appear to have combined, with increased temperatures indirectly benefiting mussels in concert with relaxed top-down pressure from sea stars, allowing for increased mussel abundance.

MHW was directly caused by great than-normal solar radiation and much weaker wind speeds which reduced upper oceanic mixing and caused substantial warming of the stratified surface layer. These anomalies were associated with an unusually fractured western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and the distinctly more active transmission of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) eastward to the western Pacific in August 2016. The MJO triggered more frequent tropical cyclones, splitting the WPSH into two parts. The western segment of the WPSH combined with the continental high to form an abnormally positive geopotential height at the west of 120?degrees E, causing strong subsiding flows at its east and extremely high solar radiation. An unambiguous cyclonic circulation anomaly in the lower troposphere, encompassing much of the northwestern Pacific, reduced the surface wind speed in the Yellow Sea. Therefore, MJO was critical to driving the extreme MHW in August 2016 in the Yellow Sea.",2022,,ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH,268,,,WOS:000770640300004,10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.106011,,#213,Li 2022,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Marine heatwaves impair the thermal refugia potential of marginal reefs in the northern South China Sea,"Mo, SH; Chen, TR; Chen, ZS; Zhang, WJ; Li, S","Frequent marine heatwaves (MHWs), concurrent with climate warming, threaten global low-latitude, pristine coral reefs, leading to growing interest in identifying marginal coral reefs (relatively high-latitude and/or turbid reef envi-ronments) that can serve as thermal refugia from mass coral bleaching. However, the thermal refugia potential of mar-ginal reefs remains controversial. We evaluated the thermal refugia potential of inshore reefs in the northern South China Sea (nSCS), a globally typical marginal reef system, by characterizing the long-term trend of MHW intensity and frequency and assessing thermal stress during a mass bleaching event in summer 2020. An unprecedented peak intensity of around 20 degrees C-weeks of cumulative heat stress, associated with a prolonged anomalous western Pacific sub-tropical high (WPSH) and weakened monsoon activity, induced record-breaking bleaching. The geographical variabil-ity of bleaching was strongly related to the extent of heat exposure and satellite-derived temperature anomalies. Under ongoing global warming, the frequency and intensity of MHWs over nSCS coral habitats show a markedly increasing trend, especially during the last decade. Intense MHWs and coral bleaching have already occurred throughout all El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases (e.g., 2010, 2015, and 2020). Climate change has pushed marginal coral reefs to or beyond the limits of their resilience, and frequent MHW events have amplified the increasing risk of thermal stress. There are no long-term thermal refugia for marginal reefs in the nSCS.",2022,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,825,,,WOS:000764242600010,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154100,,#214,Mo 2022,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
"Rain, Runoff, and Diatoms: the Effects of the North Pacific 2014-2015 Warm Anomaly on Particle Flux in a Canadian West Coast Fjord","Johannessen, SC; Macdonald, RW; Wright, CA","Sediment traps were deployed at 50m depth in Douglas Channel, a fjord on the west coast of Canada, for 3years (July 2013-July 2016). Particle flux was related to rain, freshwater discharge, and phytoplankton blooms. The North Pacific warm water anomaly (known popularly as the Blob) reached coastal waters during the second year of deployment, resulting in more autumn rain and less snow than during the other 2years. The maximum particle flux was associated with the snowfed river freshet in May during the first year and with heavy October rains during the second and third years. A protracted sedimentation event consisting of copious diatoms occurred during the warm, second winter (December 2014-February 2015). Silica (empty diatom frustules) was exported, intercepting silicate from local rivers that might otherwise have reached the outer shelf. The effects of extreme climate events are experienced differently inshore than offshore, because they are mediated by local hydrology. During the Blob year, Douglas Channel experienced exceptionally high rainfall in October, which resulted in high particle flux. As the climate continues to warm, mild, rainy years like 2014-2015 will become more common, with the possibility of further winter blooms.",2019,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,42,4,1052-1065,WOS:000465958500010,10.1007/s12237-018-00510-0,,#215,Johannessen 2019,"",heatwave; physical impact

At least 14 species of copepods occurred which had never been observed in shelf/slope waters off Oregon, some of which are known to have NP Gyre affinities, indicating that the source waters of the coastal Blob were likely of both offshore (from the west) and subtropical/tropical origin. The anomalously warm conditions were reduced during strong upwelling in spring 2015 but returned when upwelling weakened in July 2015 and transitioned to downwelling in fall 2015. The extended period of warm conditions resulted in prolonged effects on the ecosystem off central Oregon, lasting at least through 2016. Impacts to the lower trophic levels were unprecedented and include a novel plankton community composition resulting from increased copepod, diatom, and dinoflagellate species richness and increased abundance of dinoflagellates. Additionally, the multiyear warm anomalies were associated with reduced biomass of copepods and euphausiids, high abundance of larvaceans and doliolids (indictors of oligotrophic ocean conditions), and a toxic diatom bloom (Pseudo-nitzschia) throughout the California Current in 2015, thereby changing the composition of the food web that is relied upon by many commercially and ecologically important species.",2017,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,122,9,7267-7290,WOS:000413167200017,10.1002/2017JC012952,,#217,Peterson 2017,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
The Pacific Decadal Oscillation modulated marine heatwaves in the Northeast Pacific during past decades,"Ren, XL; Liu, W; Capotondi, A; Amaya, DJ; Holbrook, NJ","The Pacific Decadal Oscillation has been suggested to play an important role in driving marine heatwaves in the Northeast Pacific during recent decades. Here we combine observations and climate model simulations to show that marine heatwaves became longer, stronger and more frequent off the Northeast Pacific coast under a positive Pacific Decadal Oscillation scenario, unlike what is found during a negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation scenario. This primarily results from the different mean-state sea surface temperatures between the two Pacific Decadal Oscillation phases. Compared to the cool (negative) phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, warmer coastal sea surface temperatures occur during the positive Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase due to reduced coastal cold upwelling and increased net downward surface heat flux. Model results show that, relative to the background anthropogenic global warming, the positive Pacific Decadal Oscillation in the period 2013-2022 prolongs marine heatwaves duration by up to 43% and acts to increase marine heatwaves annual frequency by up to 32% off the Northeast Pacific coast.Marine heatwave events in the Northeast Pacific were more intense, lasted longer and occurred more frequently during positive phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation over the past 40 years, according to analyses of observations and climate model simulations.",2023,,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,4,1,,WOS:001010812200002,10.1038/s43247-023-00863-w,,#218,Ren 2023,"",heatwave; physical drivers
"Past and future impacts of marine heatwaves on small-scale fisheries in Baja California, Mexico","Villaseñor-Derbez, JC; Arafeh-Dalmau, N; Micheli, F","Marine heatwaves are globally occurring events that can negatively impact fisheries, but their impacts on small-scale operations remain understudied. We investigate the historical and future impacts of marine heatwaves on small-scale fisheries operating along a biogeographic transition zone in the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. We estimate the impacts of the most intense marine heatwave regime on record on fisheries production of 43 economic units operating in a system of 55 Territorial Use-Rights for Fisheries. During this regime, aggregate landings in the lobster, sea urchin, and sea cucumber fisheries decreased between 15 and 58%. Most operations (56%) presented large reductions in landings, whose losses more than outweigh the small increase detected for the other 44%. Notably, impacts were larger for fisheries operating near an equatorward biogeographic break, and for operations in areas of high historical environmental variation and low historical variation in fisheries production. Climate models predict an increase in the frequency and intensity of exposure to marine heatwaves for all fisheries, but the change in frequency and intensity will be greater for those in the north. In the face of extreme environmental shocks such as marine heatwaves, small-scale fisheries operating near biogeographic transition zones are among the most vulnerable.Intense marine heatwaves led to a reduction in aggregate small-scale fisheries landings of lobsters, sea urchins and sea cucumbers of up to 58% during the last two decades in the Baja California Peninsula, according to an analysis of fisheries data and sea surface temperatures.",2024,,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,5,1,,WOS:001347912700004,10.1038/s43247-024-01696-x,,#219,Villaseñor-Derbez 2024,"",heatwave; resource management
Differential Responses of Eelgrass and Macroalgae in Pacific Northwest Estuaries Following an Unprecedented NE Pacific Ocean Marine Heatwave,"Magel, CLL; Chan, FC; Hessing-Lewis, M; Hacker, SDD","The 2013-2016 northeast Pacific Ocean marine heatwave (MHW) had myriad impacts on marine communities, but little is known about how this event affected coastal estuaries. We examined the extent to which elevated temperatures associated with the offshore MHW were observed in four estuaries (Willapa Bay, Washington and Netarts Bay, Yaquina Bay, and Coos Bay, Oregon) and the responses of macrophytes at marine dominated sites within these estuaries. Records of eelgrass (Zostera marina), ulvoid macroalgae (Ulva and Enteromorpha spp.), and environmental characteristics, including water temperature, were analyzed over three periods: before (2006-2010), during (2015-2016), and after (2017-2019) the MHW. During the MHW, all four estuaries experienced ""estuarine heatwaves"" (anomalous warm water events) at monitoring stations and there was an associated decline in macroalgae biomass. In northern estuaries (Willapa and Netarts bays) where water temperatures are normally higher and estuaries are shallower, aboveground eelgrass biomass declined and did not recover for at least three years after the MHW. In southern estuaries (Yaquina and Coos bays), where water temperatures are normally colder and estuaries are deeper, the MHW was associated with a neutral, or temporarily positive, change in aboveground eelgrass biomass. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that upwelling intensity and estuarine depth determined the severity of MHW impacts on macrophytes at marine dominated sites, and that the colder and deeper estuaries in the south may serve as refuges for eelgrass but not macroalgae. We suggest that estuary-specific responses were predictable given the drivers of macrophyte abundance at marine dominated sites, and that baseline ocean upwelling and estuarine temperature can be used to anticipate macrophyte responses at marine dominated sites to MHWs in the future.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,9,,,WOS:000789028700001,10.3389/fmars.2022.838967,,#220,Magel 2022,"",ecosystem response; heatwave

The Northeast Pacific has experienced recent large-scale changes in kelp abundance and distribution, but little is known about changes north of the British Columbia (BC)-Washington border. Here, we assessed whether and how floating canopy kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera, Nereocystis luetkeana) distributions have changed in recent decades along the extensive coast of BC. We assembled and analysed available kelp distributional data, comparing snapshots of kelp linear extent from 1.5-3 decades ago (1994-2007) to recently collected data (2017-2021) across 11 different subregions spanning the province. We then leveraged timeseries, where available (n = 7 data sets), to contextualise patterns of change. In aggregate, the data suggest that kelp forests have declined considerably in some parts of the province, but with variable patterns of change across BC. In the warmest areas (southern BC), kelp persistence was negatively correlated with mean summer sea surface temperatures, which at times exceeded known thermal tolerances. In contrast, in northern subregions, top-down control by sea urchins and otters appeared to modulate kelp dynamics, with declines occurring in 2 subregions despite cool ocean temperatures. Timeseries data suggest that many declines occurred around the 2014-2016 marine heatwave, an event associated with sustained warming and altered trophic dynamics.

"Effects of the 2013-2016 Northeast Pacific warm anomaly on physical and biogeochemical variables off northwestern Baja California, derived from a numerical NPZD ocean model","Dorantes-Gilardi, M; Rivas, D","Interannual climatic anomalies have important physical and biological consequences for the southern part of the California Current System (CCS). Two examples of these anomalies are ""The Blob"" and El Nino phenomena. The Blob was an anomalously warm water mass that formed in the Gulf of Alaska during fall 2013 and then affected most of the eastern North Pacific, including the waters off Baja California, Mexico. In this work we use a biogeochemical nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (NPZD) model coupled to a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, which allowed the simulation of some of the physical and biological consequences of the anomalous warm 2013-2016 period (The Blob was observed in 2014 and El Nino by mid-2015). A model-observation comparison showed that in some cases the model solution deviates substantially from the observed vertical thermal structure, but the temporal evolution of the spatially-averaged variables diagnosed by the model shows good agreement with the observations, except for the period from late 2015 to mid-2016, when the sea surface temperature (SST) is underestimated and the model failed to reproduce the correct sign of the surface chlorophyll-a (sCHL) anomalies. An EOF analysis of the 15-year (2003-2017) record of monthly mean modeled variables allowed the identification of two main contributions to the model variability: one mode mostly correlated with the Multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index (MEI), explaining-50% of the variance of temperature (T) and dissolved nitrogen (N) and (similar to)10% of the variance of chlorophyll-a (CHL), and another mode mostly correlated with the Coastal Upwelling Index (CUI) anomaly, explaining (similar to)50-70% of variance of CHL and only (similar to)10-20% of variance of T and N. In the 2013-2016 period, an El Nino signal diagnosed by the MEI induced a remarkable warming off northwestern Baja California. As a consequence, the thermocline and the nutricline deepened during this period and caused a deepening and weakening of the subsurface CHL maximum (SCM). Around the southern region of the study area (near Punta Baja) these effects were more intense at the surface over the shelf, but in the northern region (south of Southern California Bight) the effects were more intense subsurface seaward of the shelf break. This ENSO-modulated subsurface warming tends to weaken the Southern California Eddy during El Nino events, and intensify it during La Nina episodes. During the 2013-2015 period there was also a weakening of the upwelling-favorable winds, which caused a prolonged negative anomaly of the wind forcing, reducing the nutrient flux and causing negative CHL anomalies. Finally, in addition to the partial relation between the ENSO and the warming observed along the Baja California coast, the anomalies were observed in this area 4-6 months before the onset of the El Nino conditions (MEI> 0.5) period, when the Blob was affecting the southern part of the CCS.",2019,,DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY,169,,,WOS:000504782200006,10.1016/j.dsr2.2019.104668,,#222,Dorantes-Gilardi 2019,"",ecosystem response; heatwave; physical drivers; physical impact

"Record-breaking marine heatwave in northern Yellow Sea during summer 2018: Characteristics, drivers and ecological impact","Li, Y; Ren, GY; Wang, QY; Mu, L; Niu, QR; Su, HX","Globally, marine heatwaves (MHWs) are becoming more common, more intense, and longer-lasting. They could have a large ecological and societal impact when compounded by low oxygen concentrations or high acidity. Here, using a high-resolution satellite product and reanalysis datasets, we investigated the characteristics of the MHW at northern Yellow Sea (NYS) during mid-summer 2018 and the driving mechanisms of large-scale atmospheric circulations. Results showed that the MHW in mid-summer 2018 (lasting from 26 July to 18 August 2018) had been the most intense since 1982, reaching an anomaly peak of 5.15 degrees C. For the 2018 MHW, the onset rate was 0.49 degrees C/day, indicating that the reaction window was relatively short and hard to take mitigation measures, while the decline rate was 0.19 degrees C/day, meaning the coping window was long and easy to push an already stressed system. The synergy of the two large-scale dynamic systems, i.e., the northward-shifted western north Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) and the northeastward-expanded South Asia high (SAH), was likely responsible for establishment and maintenance of the hot-weather conditions. These high-pressure systems could result in stronger descending motion, less cloud cover, more solar radiation, and smaller wind speeds which in combination aggravated the MHW. We further found that the unprecedented MHW was actually also impacted by terrestrial heatwave. From 14 July to 15 August 2018, Northeast China was affected by an exceptionally long and intense atmospheric heat wave (AHW). The AHW had impacted on the MHW through warm advection transportation and may significantly contribute to the record -breaking intensity of the MHW, in addition to the impact of abnormal atmospheric circulations.

Past disturbances and local conditions influence the recovery rates of coral reefs,"Walker, AS; Kratochwill, CA; van Woesik, R","Corals are being increasingly subjected to marine heatwaves. Theory suggests that increasing the intensity of disturbances reduces recovery rates, which inspired us to examine the recovery rates of coral cover following marine heatwaves, cyclones, and other disturbances at 1921 study sites, in 58 countries and three oceans, from 1977 to 2020. In the Atlantic Ocean, coral cover has decreased fourfold since the 1970s, and recovery rates following disturbances have been relatively slow, except in the Antilles. By contrast, reefs in the Pacific and Indian Oceans have maintained coral cover and recovery rates over time. There were positive relationships between rates of coral recovery and prior cyclone and heatwave frequency, and negative relationships between rates of coral recovery and macroalgae cover and distance to shore. A recent increase in the variance in recovery rates in some ecoregions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans suggests that some reefs in those ecoregions may be approaching a phase shift. While marine heatwaves are increasing in intensity and frequency, our results suggest that regional and local conditions influence coral recovery rates, and therefore, effective local management efforts can help reefs recover from disturbances.Coral reef recovery rates are mediated by disturbances and local conditions globally.

By analyzing two decades of kelp forest biodiversity survey data, we discovered changes in diversity, stability, and their relationships at multiple scales (biological organizational levels, spatial scales, and functional groups) that were linked with the most severe marine heatwave ever documented in the North Pacific Ocean. Moreover, changes in the strength of DSRs during/after the heatwave were more apparent among functional groups than both biological organizational levels (population vs. ecosystem levels) and spatial scales (local vs. broad scales). Specifically, the strength of DSRs decreased for fishes, increased for mobile invertebrates and understory algae, and were unchanged for sessile invertebrates during/after the heatwave.

Study on Seasonal Characteristics and Causes of Marine Heatwaves in the South China Sea over Nearly 30 Years,"Gao, ZL; Jia, WT; Zhang, WM; Wang, PQ","Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are becoming more frequent and intense in many regions around the world, as well as in China's marginal seas. However, the seasonal characteristics and associated physical drivers of MHWs are largely unknown. In this study, we analyze, based on multiple reanalysis and numerical model data, the seasonal characteristics and causes of MHWs in the South China Sea (SCS) over a near 30-year period (1991-2022). There exist significant seasonal variabilities in the spatiotemporal features and formation mechanisms of MHWs. MHWs in the SCS show significant increasing trends in terms of frequency, duration, and intensity. MHWs during the summer half-year are stronger than the winter half-year as a whole, with them being more likely to occur over the eastern SCS in the summer half-year and the western region in the winter half-year. However, the increasing trend of MHWs in the winter half-year exceed those in the summer. Additionally, we find that MHWs are associated with the unusually strong west Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) both in the summer and winter half-years. Nevertheless, the dominant factors for MHWs are different in the varied seasons. According to upper ocean temperature equation analysis, surface heat flux anomalies (especially shortwave radiation flux) are major effect factors in the summer half-year, while ocean dynamic processes play the main role in the winter half-year. An analysis of the typical MHWs also proves this conclusion. Moreover, MHWs occurring in winter are often accompanied by temperature anomalies within the mixed-layer depth. The findings imply that the formation mechanisms and space-time distribution of MHWs exist with a seasonal contrast in the SCS, rather than simply being due to large-scale circulation and flux anomalies. This may provide a useful reference for a deeper understanding and forecasting of MHWs under different seasons and weather.",2023,,ATMOSPHERE,14,12,,WOS:001130925100001,10.3390/atmos14121822,,#233,Gao 2023,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Temporal dynamics of the deep-sea pink urchin<i> Strongylocentrotus</i><i> fragilis</i> on the Northeast Pacific continental margin,"Command, RJ; De Leo, FC; Robert, K","The Northeast Pacific continental margin is characterized by strong seasonal upwelling, which drives high pri-mary productivity, and supports high diversity and biomass of benthic megafauna. The recent occurrence of a marine heat wave (""The Blob"", sensu Kintisch, 2015) in 2013-2016 resulted in changes to phytoplankton community composition and loss of coastal kelp abundance and diversity, reducing gross primary productivity in the region. However, cumulative effects of marine heat waves and ongoing basin-scale deoxygenation in deep-sea ecosystems remain poorly understood. Here, we use a 7-year time series of physicochemical and video im-agery data from Ocean Networks Canada's NEPTUNE observatory to investigate temporal dynamics of the deep-sea pink urchin Strongylocentrotus fragilis in relation to multi-year environmental variability. Using generalized additive models, we show that local S. fragilis density at Barkley Upper Slope (420 m) fluctuated over time and was partially explained by changes in dissolved oxygen concentration and suspended particulate matter in the benthic boundary layer (ADCP backscatter), with high urchin density corresponding to high oxygen and low backscatter. Seafloor dissolved oxygen ranged from 0.80 to 1.89 mL/L and varied seasonally, exhibiting a clear negative correlation with sea surface primary productivity (MODIS satellite Chl-a data), corresponding with the onset of yearly upwelling conditions. However, during the anomalously warm years affected by 'The Blob', dampened upwelling maintained higher dissolved oxygen conditions near the seafloor. S. fragilis density declined during 'Blob' conditions, likely in response to reduced kelp and phytodetritus subsidies from coastal waters. We propose a foraging-respiration trade-off hypothesis, whereby S. fragilis forages in deeper water during weak upwelling and migrates to shallower habitats during low oxygen conditions. S. fragilis is an important bioturbator and detritivore; changes in the density and distribution of this species may directly affect sediment turnover rates and nutrient cycling on the continental margin, with consequences for surface and coastal productivity. https://github.com/rjcommand/.",2023,,DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS,193,,,WOS:000994907600001,10.1016/j.dsr.2022.103958,,#235,Command 2023,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
"Minimal effects of the 2014-16 marine heatwave on fish assemblages found in eelgrass meadows on the southwestern coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada","Robinson, CLK; Yakimishyn, J; Evans, R","The main objective of this study was to ascertain if the 2014 to 2016 spring marine heatwaves, had a significant effect on early summer fish assemblage species composition, abundance and biomass in eelgrass meadows. It was presumed that increased water temperatures above the 90(th) percentile of the 30y long-term spring temperatures would result in changes to fish growth, survival and ultimately lead to changes in early summer settlement to eelgrass. We assessed this by analyzing the catch per unit effort of 18 common fish species and total fish assemblage biomass in 22 eelgrass meadows from two study areas in the northern California Current during the early summer over an 18 year period from 2004 to 2021. A control chart analysis indicated that eelgrass fish assemblages during heatwave years (2015-16) were significantly higher than the 90(th) percentile in Bray Curtis dissimilarity of 13 baseline years. Furthermore, analysis of similarity indicated that about one half of the 18 fish species showed variable contributing increases or decreases in catch per unit effort during the heatwave period. In addition, the same fish families from the two study areas only 100km apart did not respond in synchrony to the MHW. We could not however detect any changes in eelgrass fish species composition or assemblage level biomass during the heatwave years. An analysis of the temporal trajectory over the 17y time series in the ordination plots also revealed that changes in fish assemblage dissimilarity during the 2015 and 2016 heatwave returned quickly to levels observed during baseline.

Changes in the overwintering diet of Steller sea lions<i> (Eumetopias</i><i> jubatus)</i> in relation to the 2014-2016 northeast Pacific marine heatwave,"Maniscalco, JM","Understanding variation in the diets of endangered species during critical time periods in their annual cycle is of utmost importance because of the effects that diet can have on vital rates and population trends. This may be especially true for Endangered Steller sea lions during the winter months when prey can be difficult to find, and many adult females are both lactating and pregnant. This study aimed to examine changes in the overwintering diet of Steller sea lions across an extreme climatic event, the northeast Pacific marine heatwave (PMH) that adversely affected this species and broadly impacted many others throughout the trophic spectrum. Diet analysis was conducted from scat samples using hard part remains and qPCR methods. Prior to the peak impact of the PMH, Steller sea lions fed predominantly on epipelagic and mesopelagic fishes such as capelin, walleye pollock and Pacific cod. Following the warm-water peak, capelin was strongly reduced in their diet, and diet diversity increased with greater presence of demersal and benthic prey such as skates, lumpsuckers, snailfish, and polychaetes. These results suggest that sea lions were having a difficult time finding their preferred prey, spending time searching deeper to find alternative prey with poorer energy content following the peak impact of the PMH. These changes in diet corresponded with fewer pups being born and a reduction in overall sea lion numbers in the study area, providing evidence that overwintering prey fields may have a sub-stantial impact on population health.",2023,,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,43,,,WOS:001042923800001,10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02427,,#238,Maniscalco 2023,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
"Influence of the 2014-2016 marine heatwave on seasonal zooplankton community structure and abundance in the lower Cook Inlet, Alaska","McKinstry, CAE; Campbell, RW; Holderied, K","During the 2014-2016 Pacific marine heatwave (MHW), seabird die-offs, declines in forage fish populations, and the appearance of subtropical marine taxa (e.g. ocean sunfish, skipjack tuna) occurred in the northern Gulf of Alaska; however, the response of the zooplankton community to the MHW remains poorly understood. As part of the Gulf Watch Alaska program in Cook Inlet, zooplankton, phytoplankton, and a suite of oceanographic variables were collected monthly from 2012 to 2018. Surface zooplankton were collected via vertical tows (0-50 m) with a 333 mu m bongo net along with CTD data and chlorophyll a concentration. Generalized additive models showed that seasonal zooplankton abundance peaked mid-June and declined into late January. During the MHW, monthly temperature anomalies ranged from +0.2 to +2.8 degrees C in 2015 and 2016, but monthly means of large lipid-rich calanoid copepods showed no clear declines in abundance compared to before and after the MHW suggesting that these copepods had some resiliency. An indicator species analysis using 88 of the most common zooplankton taxa produced five groups of zooplankton based on season. A BIO-ENV Best model showed that the environmental variables best explaining the observed zooplankton community structure included SST, temperature of the top 50 m of the water column, mixed layer depth (MLD), MLD temperature, and integrated chl a (rho = 0.3491, Mantel Test: r = 0.3491, alpha < 0.05). Seasonal transitions of community groups displayed a phenological shift in 2016 when the late spring group of meroplanktonic larvae and the fall group of warm water copepods (WWC) typical of the Northern California Current system appeared earlier and persisted for longer compared to before and after the MHW. WWC abundance increased during the fall seasons of the MHW. Throughout 2015-2016, the elevated abundance of WWC compared to previous years and before/after the MHW suggested that warmer than average oceanographic conditions in the winter of 2015/2016 may have been sufficient to allow for an overwintering population in this area. A potential overwintering population of a warm water predatory copepod, Corycaeus anglicus, was observed and may have direct fine scale predator/prey impacts on zooplankton in this region.",2022,,DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY,195,,,WOS:000744028400001,10.1016/j.dsr2.2021.105012,,#240,McKinstry 2022,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Influence of environmental variability on the distribution and abundance of the pantropical spotted dolphin (<i>Stenella attenuata</i>) in the Mexican Central Pacific,"Díaz-Torres, ER; Marín-Enríquez, E; Corgos, A; Olivos-Ortiz, A; Ortega-Ortiz, CD","The Mexican Central Pacific (MCP) has complex oceanographic dynamics, with a well-defined seasonal pattern and influence of interannual sea surface temperature anomalies. The present study investigated the relationship between the distribution/abundance of spotted dolphins and the environmental conditions in the MCP. Dolphin sighting data were collected during January 2010-December 2015; distance to coast, sea surface temperature, and chlorophyll a (Chla) were obtained for each sighting location through georeferenced maps and satellite images. A total of 746 spotted dolphin sightings were obtained with a survey effort of 31,695 km. Spotted dolphins in the MCP showed a predominantly coastal distribution regardless of environmental conditions. Significant differences were detected concerning regional seasonal variation, with higher mean sighting rate during the stratified periods and higher density/abundance estimates during the mixed periods. Spotted dolphins showed preference for warmer conditions, with higher mean sighting rate, abundance, and distance to coast during the neutral and warm interannual periods. During the coolest conditions (cold periods), mean sighting rate and abundance decreased and spotted dolphins were located closer to the coast, where Chla concentration increased. These results suggest that changes in the distribution/abundance of these dolphins could be associated with habitat quality related to tropical (El Nino/Southern Oscillation) and extratropical (The Blob) oceanographic phenomena, which could be modulating their foraging activities.",2022,,CIENCIAS MARINAS,48,1,,WOS:000782835000001,10.7773/cm.y2022.3215,,#241,Díaz-Torres 2022,Helen Killeen (2025-08-06 02:40:37)(Select): bilingual; ,ecosystem response; heatwave

Increasing Coupling Between NPGO and PDO Leads to Prolonged Marine Heatwaves in the Northeast Pacific,"Joh, Y; Di Lorenzo, E","The marine heatwave of 2014/2015 in the Northeast Pacific caused significant impacts on marine ecosystems and fisheries. While several studies suggest that land and marine heatwaves may intensify under climate change, less is known about the prolonged multiyear nature (similar to 2 years) of the Northeast Pacific events. Examination of reanalysis products and a 30-member climate model ensemble confirms that prolonged multiyear marine heatwaves are linked to the dynamics of the two dominant modes of winter sea surface temperature variability in the North Pacific, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). Specifically, we find a significant correlation between winter warm NPGO anomalies and the following winter PDO arising from extratropical/tropical teleconnections. In the model projections for 2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario, this NPGO/PDO 1 year lag correlation exhibits a significant positive trend (similar to 35%) that favors more prolonged multiyear warm events (>1 degrees C) with larger spatial coverage (similar to 18%) and higher maximum amplitude (similar to 0.5 degrees C for events >2 degrees C) over the Northeast Pacific.",2017,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,44,22,11663-11671,WOS:000419102300050,10.1002/2017GL075930,,#246,Joh 2017,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Recent marine heatwaves in the North Pacific warming pool can be attributed to rising atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases,"Barkhordarian, A; Nielsen, DM; Baehr, J","Over the last decade, the northeast Pacific experienced marine heatwaves that caused devastating marine ecological impacts with socioeconomic implications. Here we use two different attribution methods and show that forcing by elevated greenhouse gases levels has virtually certainly caused the multi-year persistent 2019-2021 marine heatwave. There is less than 1% chance that the 2019-2021 event with similar to 3 years duration and 1.6 degrees C intensity could have happened in the absence of greenhouse gases forcing. We further discover that the recent marine heatwaves are co-located with a systematically-forced outstanding warming pool, which we attribute to forcing by elevated greenhouse gases levels and the recent industrial aerosol-load decrease. The here-detected Pacific long-term warming pool is associated with a strengthening ridge of high-pressure system, which has recently emerged from the natural variability of climate system, indicating that they will provide favorable conditions over the northeast Pacific for even more severe marine heatwave events in the future.",2022,,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,3,1,,WOS:000814253500001,10.1038/s43247-022-00461-2,,#247,Barkhordarian 2022,"",attribution study; heatwave; physical drivers
Persistence of southern California giant kelp beds and alongshore variation in nutrient exposure driven by seasonal upwelling and internal waves,"Leichter, JJ; Ladah, LB; Parnell, PE; Stokes, MD; Costa, MT; Fumo, J; Dayton, PK","Kelp beds provide significant ecosystem services and socioeconomic benefits globally, and prominently in coastal zones of the California Current. Their distributions and abundance, however, vary greatly over space and time. Here, we describe long-term patterns of Giant Kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) sea surface canopy area off the coast of San Diego County from 1983 through 2019 along with recent patterns of water column nitrate (NO3-) exposure inferred from in situ temperature data in 2014 and 2015 at sites spanning 30 km of the coastline near San Diego California, USA. Site-specific patterns of kelp persistence and resilience were associated with ocean and climate dynamics, with total sea surface kelp canopy area varying approximately 33-fold over the almost 4 decades (min 0.34 km(2) in 1984; max 11.25 km(2) in 2008, median 4.79 km(2)). Site-normalized canopy areas showed that recent kelp persistence since 2014 was greater at Point Loma and La Jolla, the largest kelp beds off California, than at the much smaller kelp bed off Cardiff. NO3- exposure was estimated from an 11-month time series of in situ water column temperature collected in 2014 and 2015 at 4 kelp beds, using a relationship between temperature and NO3- concentration previously established for the region. The vertical position of the 14.5 degrees C isotherm, an indicator of the main thermocline and nutricline, varied across the entire water column at semidiurnal to seasonal frequencies. We use a novel means of quantifying estimated water column NO3- exposure integrated through time (mol-days m(-2)) adapted from degree days approaches commonly used to characterize thermal exposures. Water column integrated NO3- exposure binned by quarters of the time series showed strong seasonal differences with highest exposure in Mar - May 2015, lowest exposure in Sep - Dec 2014, with consistently highest exposure off Point Loma. The water column integrated NO3- signal was filtered to provide estimates of the contribution to total nitrate exposure from high frequency variability (integral >= 1 cycle 30 hr(-1)) associated predominantly with internal waves, and low frequency variability driven predominantly by seasonal upwelling. While seasonal upwelling accounted for > 90% of NO3- exposure across the full year, during warm periods when seasonal upwelling was reduced or absent and NO3- exposure was low overall, the proportion due to internal waves increased markedly to 84 to 100% of the site-specific total exposure. The high frequency variability associated with internal waves may supply critical nutrient availability during anomalously warm periods. Overall, these analyses support a hypothesis that differences in NO3- exposure among sites due to seasonal upwelling and higher frequency internal wave forcing contribute to spatial patterns in Giant Kelp persistence in southern California. The study period includes anomalously warm surface conditions and the marine heatwave associated with the ""Pacific Warm Blob"" superimposed on the seasonal thermal signal and corresponding to the onset of a multi-year decline in kelp canopy area and marked differences in kelp persistence among sites.Our analysis suggests that, particularly during periods of warm surface conditions, variation in NO3- exposure associated with processes occurring at higher frequencies, including internal waves can be a significant source of NO3- exposure to kelp beds in this region. The patterns described here also offer a view of the potential roles of seasonal and higher frequency nutrient dynamics for Giant Kelp persistence in southern California under continuing ocean surface warming and increasing frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves.",2023,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,10,,,WOS:000963692700001,10.3389/fmars.2023.1007789,,#248,Leichter 2023,"",attribution study; ecosystem response; heatwave; physical drivers

Species richness, abundance, and carbon biomass of euphausiids and mysids were investigated from a weekly daytime surface zooplankton time series from 2014 to 2017, in relation to 15 environmental variables at Cabo Pulmo National Park (CPNP, 23 degrees 27 ' N, 109 degrees 25 ' W), Mexico. A marine heatwave (MHW; January-August 2014) and El Nin similar to o 2015-2016 (May 2015-May 2016) caused anomalously warm temperatures in relation to the 2002-2018 temperature time series. We tested the hypotheses that CPNP is dominated by a tropical euphausiid and mysid species assemblage and that abundance of both taxonomic groups decreased during the MHW 2014 and El Nin similar to o 2015-2016. Euphausiids (7.9 ind. m-3) had a higher mean abundance than mysids (3.4 ind. m-3). Eight euphausiid species, mostly of tropical-oceanic affinity, were collected (98 % larvae). Nyctiphanes simplex decreased and Euphausia distinguenda and Stylocheiron carinatum increased in abundance during El Nin similar to o 2015-2016. Five mysid species were collected (juveniles and adults). Mysidium rickettsi alone accounted for 99.98 % of total mysid abundance. Although the euphausiids collected were mainly larval stages, due to sam-pling in shallow coastal waters during the day, they contributed more biomass than juvenile and adult M. rickettsi in the pelagic habitat, though the abundance of this mysid in its epibenthonic habitat was likely underestimated. A canonical correspondence analysis of euphausiid and mysid abundance as a function of 10 environmental variables explained 77.4 % of the total variability, showing greater seasonal (warm vs cold) than interannual changes. The best correlated environmental variables with euphausiid and M. rickettsi abundance were net primary production (-0.419), zooplankton biovolume (0.3177) and the MEI.v2 (-0.278). We concluded that the most evident changes in community structure and abundance were seasonal (e.g. N. simplex dominated during the cold season while E. distinguenda dominated during the warm season) rather than interannual. Moreover, the abundance and biomass of euphausiids decreased during the MHW 2014 and El Nin similar to o 2015-2016; paradoxically the highest abundance and biomass of E. distinguenda and the mysid M. rickettsi occurred during El Nin similar to o 2015-2016.

Spatio-temporal variation in zooplankton community composition in the southern Salish Sea: Changes during the 2015-2016 Pacific marine heatwave,"Winans, AK; Herrmann, B; Keister, JE","We examined zooplankton collected across a latitudinal gradient in the southern Salish Sea for changes during the 2015-2016 Pacific marine heatwave (MHW). Zooplankton were collected biweekly in vertical net tows from three regions of Puget Sound and one in northern Washington waters near the Strait of Juan de Fuca, from 2014 to 2020. Water temperatures were cooler in the north and warmer in the south, with anomalously high tem-peratures occurring in 2015-2016 in all regions. Chlorophyll biomass showed no consistent relationship with temperature. All regions had anomalously high zooplankton biomass in 2015, which continued in the three Puget Sound regions through 2017, with the two central stations showing the most dramatic increases. Several large crustacean species and molluscs showed positive biomass anomalies during the MHW. Euphausiid furcilia showed differential response by species. Puget Sound resident copepod species showed primarily positive anomalies, while some boreal and subarctic copepod species were anomalously low during this period. Gelati-nous zooplankton had somewhat higher biomass through the first few years of the study, but patterns showed no clear relationship with the MHW. Differing zooplankton patterns compared to those observed in the California Current, as well as prolonged effects on zooplankton biomass in Puget Sound, suggest that local forcing played a dominant role, likely differing from the mechanisms affecting zooplankton in the California Current. Primary postulated factors include increased growth and metabolism due to higher temperatures, nutrient-driven in-creases in primary production, and changes in species composition advected from the ocean.

Oceanic differences in coral-bleaching responses to marine heatwaves,"Shlesinger, T; van Woesik, R","Anomalously high ocean temperatures have increased in frequency, intensity, and duration over the last several decades because of greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming and marine heatwaves. Reef-building corals are sensitive to such temperature anomalies that commonly lead to coral bleaching, mortality, and changes in community structure. Yet, despite these overarching effects, there are geographical differences in thermal regimes, evolutionary histories, and past disturbances that may lead to different bleaching responses of corals within and among oceans. Here we examined the overall bleaching responses of corals in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, using both a spatially explicit Bayesian mixed-effects model and a deep-learning neural-network model. We used a 40-year global dataset encompassing 23,288 coral-reef surveys at 11,058 sites in 88 countries, from 1980 to 2020. Focusing on ocean-wide differences we assessed the relationships between the percentage of bleached corals and different temperature-related metrics alongside a suite of environmental variables. We found that while high sea-surface temperatures were consistently, and strongly, related to coral bleaching within all oceans, there were clear geographical differences in the relationships between coral bleaching and most environmental variables. For instance, there was an increase in coral bleaching with depth in the Atlantic Ocean whereas the opposite was observed in the Indian Ocean, and no clear trend could be seen in the Pacific Ocean. The standard deviation of thermal-stress anomalies was negatively related to coral bleaching in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but not in the Indian Ocean. Globally, coral bleaching has progressively occurred at higher temperatures over the last four decades within the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, although, again, there were differences among the three oceans. Together, such patterns highlight that historical circumstances and geographical differences in oceanographic conditions play a central role in contemporary coral-bleaching responses.",2023,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,871,,,WOS:000942854800001,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162113,,#252,Shlesinger 2023,"Helen Killeen (2025-10-15 10:09:42)(Select): Looks like some of their data relate to Hawaii, so I'm including with the GLOBAL caveat tag. ; KAREN HUNTER (2025-08-26 05:33:34)(Select): Global, reference to Pacific but not ""north Pacific""; ",GLOBAL; ecosystem response; heatwave
Classification and Causes of East Asian Marine Heatwaves during Boreal Summer,"Oh, H; Kim, GU; Kim, YS; Park, JH; Jang, CJ; Min, Y; Jun, H; Jeong, JY","Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are among the most severe climatic events under global warming conditions; they damage marine ecosystems and result in socioeconomic losses. In East Asia, the sea surface temperature (SST) has in-creased significantly and is projected to increase further. Considering such increases in SST over East Asia, studies on MHWs are needed to minimize the damage caused. In this study, we classified the spatiotemporal characteristics of East Asian MHWs during boreal summer with a self-organizing map for 39 years (1982-2020) and determined their unexplored possible mechanisms. Four dominant modes of MHWs across East Asia were identified: the 1) Subtropical Gyre, 2) East China Sea, 3) East Sea/Japan Sea, and 4) Yellow Sea modes. The total annual number of MHW days has increased by about 1.23 days yr -1. The significant trend is mainly determined by the Subtropical Gyre mode, whereas other modes do not exhibit significant trends. We found that the East China Sea mode could be attributed to a strong East Asian summer monsoon via ocean stratification by the low-salinity water from the Yangtze (Changjiang) River. The East Sea/Japan Sea and Yellow Sea modes could be linked to remote forcings over the subtropics, leading to persistent anticyclonic circulation over East Asia. The anomalous anticyclone contributed to the MHW occurrences by enhancing downward shortwave radiation and reducing entrainment cooling caused by Ekman downwelling. These findings have important implications for distinguishing the characteristics of East Asian MHWs and reveal the possibility of predicting them by identifying their precursors.",2023,,JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,36,5,1435-1449,WOS:000950640300001,10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0369.1,,#253,Oh 2023,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Large and transient positive temperature anomalies in Washington's coastal nearshore waters during the 2013-2015 northeast Pacific marine heatwave,"Koehlinger, JA; Newton, J; Mickett, J; Thompson, L; Klinger, T","The northern portion of Washington's outer coast-known locally as the Olympic coast-is a dynamic region characterized by seasonal upwelling that predominates during summer interrupted by occasional periods of downwelling. We examined spring-to-fall water temperature records collected along this coast from 2001-2015 from April to October at four nearshore locations (Cape Elizabeth to Makah Bay) that span one degree of latitude and are located within 15 km of the shore. When compared against a long-term climatology created for 2001-2013, seven-day smoothed temperature anomalies of up to 4.5 degrees C at 40 m depth during 2014 and 2015 show short-term warm events lasting 10-20 days. These periods of warming occurred within the well documented marine heatwave in the Northeast Pacific and were about twice the seasonal temperature range in the climatology at that depth. These warm events were strongly correlated with periods of northward long-shore winds and upper ocean currents, consistent with what is expected for the response to downwelling-favorable winds. While our focus a priori was on 2014 and 2015, we also found large positive temperature events in 2013, which were potentially related to the early stage of the marine heatwave, and in 2011, which did not have a documented marine heatwave. This indicates that near-shore short-term warm events occur during periods of large-scale offshore marine heatwave events, but also can occur in the absence of a large-scale marine heatwave event when downwelling-favorable winds occur during the summer/early fall.",2023,,PLOS ONE,18,2,,WOS:000960064500001,10.1371/journal.pone.0280646,,#254,Koehlinger 2023,"",physical drivers
Physiological acclimatization in high-latitude zooplankton,"Roncalli, V; Niestroy, J; Cieslak, MC; Castelfranco, AM; Hopcroft, RR; Lenz, PH","How individual organisms adapt to nonoptimal conditions through physiological acclimatization is central to predicting the consequences of unusual abiotic and biotic conditions such as those produced by marine heat waves. The Northeast Pacific, including the Gulf of Alaska, experienced an extreme warming event (2014-2016, ""The Blob"") that affected all trophic levels and led to large-scale changes in the community. The marine copepod Neocalanus flemingeri is a key member of the subarctic Pacific pelagic ecosystem. During the spring phytoplankton bloom this copepod builds substantial lipid stores as it prepares for its nonfeeding adult phase. A 3-year comparison of gene expression profiles of copepods collected in Prince William Sound in the Gulf of Alaska between 2015 and 2017 included two high-temperature years (2015 and 2016) and one year with very low phytoplankton abundances (2016). The largest differences in gene expression were between high and low chlorophyll years, and not between warm and cool years. The observed gene expression patterns were indicative of physiological acclimatization. The predominant signal in 2016 was the down-regulation of genes involved in glycolysis and its incoming pathways, consistent with the modulation of metabolic rates in response to prolonged low food conditions. Despite the down-regulation of genes involved in metabolism, there was no evidence of suppression of protein synthesis based on gene expression or behavioural activity. Genes involved in muscle function were up-regulated, and the copepods were actively swimming and responsive to stimuli at collection. However, genes involved in fatty acid metabolism were down-regulated in 2016, suggesting reduced lipid accumulation.",2022,,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,31,6,1753-1765,WOS:000752109500001,10.1111/mec.16354,,#255,Roncalli 2022,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Long-term trends and extreme events of marine heatwaves in the Eastern China Marginal Seas during summer,"Xu, J; Yan, YW; Zhang, L; Xing, W; Meng, LX; Yu, Y; Chen, CL","Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are a type of widespread, persistent, and extreme marine warming event that can cause serious harm to the global marine ecology and economy. This study provides a systematic analysis of the long-term trends of MHWs in the Eastern China Marginal Seas (ECMS) during summer spanning from 1982 to 2022, and occurrence mechanisms of extreme MHW events. The findings show that in the context of global warming, the frequency of summer MHWs in the ECMS has increased across most regions, with a higher rate along the coast of China. Areas exhibiting a rapid surge in duration predominantly reside in the southern Yellow Sea (SYS) and southern East China Sea (ECS, south of 28 degrees N). In contrast, the long-term trends of mean and maximum intensities exhibit both increases and decreases: Rising trends primarily occur in the Bohai Sea (BS) and Yellow Sea (YS), whereas descending trends are detected in the northern ECS (north of 28 degrees N). Influenced jointly by duration and mean intensity, cumulative intensity (CumInt) exhibits a notable positive growth off the Yangtze River Estuary, in the SYS and southern ECS. By employing the empirical orthogonal function, the spatio-temporal features of the first two modes of CumInt and their correlation with summer mean sea surface temperature (SST) and SST variance are further examined. The first mode of CumInt displays a positive anomalous pattern throughout the ECMS, with notable upward trend in the corresponding time series, and the rising trend is primarily influenced by summer mean SST warming. Moreover, both of the first two modes show notable interannual variability. Extreme MHW events in the SYS in 2016 and 2018 are examined using the mixed layer temperature equation. The results suggest that these extreme MHW events originate primarily from anomalous atmospheric forcing and oceanic vertical mixing.

Using monthly open-ocean observations over the period 1982-2019, we show that globally 1.8 in 100 months (or about one out of five present-day MHW months) are compound MHW-OAX event months under a present-day baseline, almost twice as many as expected for 90th percentile extreme event exceedances if MHWs and OAX events were statistically independent. Compound MHW-OAX events are most likely in the subtropics (2.7 in 100 months; 10 degrees-40 degrees latitude) and less likely in the equatorial Pacific and the mid-to-high latitudes (0.7 in 100 months; >40 degrees latitude). The likelihood pattern results from opposing effects of temperature and dissolved inorganic carbon on [H+]. The likelihood is higher where the positive effect on [H+] from increased temperatures during MHWs outweighs the negative effect on [H+] from co-occurring decreases in dissolved inorganic carbon. Daily model output from a large-ensemble simulation of an Earth system model is analyzed to assess changes in the MHW-OAX likelihood under climate change. The projected long-term mean warming and acidification trends have the largest effect on the number of MHW-OAX days per year, increasing it from 12 to 265 days per year at 2 degrees C global warming relative to a fixed pre-industrial baseline. Even when long-term trends are removed, an increase in [H+] variability leads to a 60% increase in the number of MHW-OAX days under 2 degrees C global warming. These projected increases may cause severe impacts on marine ecosystems.Compound extreme events in two or more oceanic ecosystem stressors are increasingly considered as a major concern for marine life.

Using mark-recapture methods on the largest individual photo-identification dataset ever assembled for a cetacean, we estimated annual ocean-basin-wide abundance for the species from 2002 through 2021. Trends in annual estimates describe strong post-whaling era population recovery from 16 875 (+/- 5955) in 2002 to a peak abundance estimate of 33 488 (+/- 4455) in 2012. An apparent 20% decline from 2012 to 2021, 33 488 (+/- 4455) to 26 662 (+/- 4192), suggests the population abruptly reached carrying capacity due to loss of prey resources. This was particularly evident for humpback whales wintering in Hawai'i, where, by 2021, estimated abundance had declined by 34% from a peak in 2013, down to abundance levels previously seen in 2006, and contrasted to an absence of decline in Mainland Mexico breeding humpbacks. The strongest marine heatwave recorded globally to date during the 2014-2016 period appeared to have altered the course of species recovery, with enduring effects.

Breeding seabirds increase foraging range in response to an extreme marine heatwave,"Osborne, OE; O'Hara, PD; Whelan, S; Zandbergen, P; Hatch, SA; Elliott, KH","Marine heatwaves are increasing in frequency and can disrupt marine ecosystems non-linearly. In this study, we examined the effect of the North Pacific warming event of 2014, the largest long-term sea surface anomaly on record, on black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla foraging trips before, during, and after the event. We assessed foraging trip characteristics (trip distance and duration), the dispersal of foraging locations, and the persistence of foraging areas within and among years. Foraging trip characteristics, foraging area size, and location varied from year to year. Kittiwake foraging was more dispersed, direct, and farther from the colony in years immediately after and during the warming event. A third of the foraging area used pre-heatwave (2012) was important in subsequent years, which indicates that this area was, and may still be, a perennial foraging hot spot. During the chick-rearing stage, black-legged kittiwakes increased their speed and reduced the proportion of resting compared to the incubation stage.

Stark Physical and Biogeochemical Differences and Implications for Ecosystem Stressors in the Northeast Pacific Coastal Ocean,"Dosser, HV; Waterman, S; Jackson, JM; Hannah, CG; Evans, W; Hunt, BPV","Regional differences in water properties and responses to stressors are key to understanding ecosystem vulnerabilities in coastal regions globally. Our study focuses on Canada's British Columbia coastal waters, from Queen Charlotte Strait to the Strait of Georgia. This area is bisected by shallow, narrow, tidally mixed channels with some of the strongest tidal currents in the world. We examine differences between regions on either side of this constriction, focusing on physical water properties and responses to three potential physical and biogeochemical stressors: nutrient levels, marine heatwaves, and ocean acidification. Our results quantify a spatially abrupt and temporally persistent lateral gradient in temperature, salinity, and density co-located with a previously documented strong mixing zone. The distributions of density on either side of this front remain largely distinct throughout the tidal cycle, for all seasons, and for over 70 individual years for which data are available. Additionally, nutrient concentrations and molar ratios north of the front are statistically distinct from those to the south, and regions north of the front responded more strongly to the arrival of the marine heatwave known as ""The Blob"". Lastly, regional differences in sensitivity to ocean acidification are identified, with high pCO(2) values at the surface in the Discovery Islands making that area very sensitive to ocean acidification. These results demonstrate the degree to which dramatic water property differences in adjacent coastal regions can persist over a wide range of time scales, with important connections to their responses to environmental stressors and implications for present and future ecosystem vulnerability.Plain Language Summary Regional differences in coastal waters are key to understanding marine ecosystem vulnerabilities. Our study focuses on British Columbia Canada, from Queen Charlotte Strait to the Strait of Georgia.

Our results show that water properties such as temperature, salinity, and density differ between the two halves of the study area, and persist throughout the tidal cycle and year-round, for over 70 individual years. Additionally, the levels of nutrients and their relative concentrations differ, and regions north of the front experienced more extreme temperatures following the arrival of the marine heatwave known as ""The Blob"". Lastly, regions on either side of the front are found to have different sensitivities to ocean acidification, with the highest sensitivity in the Discovery Islands.

The relative influence of temperature and ontogeny on groundfish distribution varies across life stages,"Li, LB; Hollowed, AB; Cokelet, ED; Keller, AA; Barbeaux, SJ; Mcclure, MM; Palsson, WA","Distributional changes for fish populations may be difficult to interpret since temperature responses are often confounded with ontogenetic shifts. However, the relative importance of these two types of fish movement (temperature responses and ontogenetic shifts) to population distribution remains largely unstudied. This study presents the first attempt to compare the two types of movement in depth, latitude and longitude for 10 abundant groundfish species across size class and subregion. We utilized large, quality-controlled datasets from random depth-stratified, bottom trawl surveys consistently conducted during the summer along NE Pacific shelf from 1996 to 2015. We show that the size structure of each species varied across years and subregions with dramatically strong or poor recruitments for some species in 2015 during a marine heatwave. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that ontogenetic shifts in depth represented the primary movement pattern while temperature responses in latitude and longitude constituted a major, but a secondary pattern. Re-run by size class, PCA results further showed that the influence of temperature and ontogeny on population distribution varied by size classes with greater ontogenetic shifts in smaller fish and elevated temperature responses in larger fish. We further show substantial ontogeny-induced movements by depth, latitude and longitude with high variability among species and subregions. Our analyses suggest that failing to account for size structure can lead to serious misinterpretation of population distributional changes in all three dimensions: depth, latitude and longitude for populations with or without episodic recruitments.",2024,,FISH AND FISHERIES,25,1,82-96,WOS:001069132900001,10.1111/faf.12792,,#263,Li 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
El Nino and marine heatwaves: Ecological impacts on Oregon rocky intertidal kelp communities at local to regional scales,"Spiecker, BJ; Menge, BA","El Ninos and marine heatwaves (MHWs) are predicted to increase in frequency under greenhouse warming. The impact of climate oscillations like El Nino-Southern Oscillation on coastal environments in the short term likely mimics those of climate change in the long term; therefore, El Ninos may serve as a short-term proxy for possible long-term ecological responses to an increasingly variable climate. Understanding and prediction of ecosystem responses requires elucidating the mechanisms underlying different organizational scales (organism, space, and time). We analyzed spatiotemporal variation in the effect of the 2015-2016 El Nino and the overlapping 2014-2016 East Pacific MHW on three intertidal kelps (Hedophyllum sessile, Egregia menziesii, and Postelsia palmaeformis) at seven sites across 300 km of the Oregon coast and over three years post El Nino. We measured percent cover, density, maximum length, growth, and carbon : nitrogen (C:N) ratios monthly in spring/summer at each site from 2016 through 2018. Results revealed a complex interplay between spatial, temporal, and biological factors that modified the effects of these thermal anomalies on Oregon intertidal kelp populations. Our findings generally agree with prior literature showing detrimental effects of El Nino on kelp. However, El Nino and possibly MHW effects can be mitigated or amplified by environmental processes and kelp life history strategies. In our study, coastal upwelling provided regional relief for the kelp individuals with respect to their growth needs and mitigated the adverse effects of warming. On the other hand, we also found that coastal upwelling amplified, or compounded, detrimental effects of El Nino by increasing phytoplankton-induced shading and mollusk grazing on juvenile and adult kelps, thereby reducing their density. Given the greater uncertainty associated with warming events and climate change in the California Current Upwelling System and its biological implications, our findings reiterate the importance of acquiring better understanding of how context-specific underlying conditions modify ecosystem processes. More specifically, understanding how demographic traits and life history stages of kelp change with biological interactions and environmental forcing over temporal and spatial scales is crucial to anticipating future climate change ramifications.",2022,,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,92,2,,WOS:000763267200001,10.1002/ecm.1504,,#266,Spiecker 2022,"",ecosystem response; heatwave

Using a combination of citizen science and federal data sets, we investigated the causal mechanisms of the 2014/2015 die-off of Cassin's Auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), a small zooplanktivorous seabird, during the NE Pacific MHW of 2013-2015. Carcass deposition followed an effective reduction in the energy content of mesozooplankton, coincident with the loss of cold-water foraging habitat caused by the intrusion of the NE Pacific MHW into the nearshore environment. Models examining interannual variability in effort-controlled carcass abundance (2001-2014) identified the biomass of lipid-poor zooplankton as the dominant predictor of increased carcass abundance. In 2014, Cassin's Auklets dispersing from colonies in British Columbia likely congregated into a nearshore band of cooler upwelled water and ultimately died from starvation following the shift in zooplankton composition associated with onshore transport of the NE Pacific MHW. For Cassin's Auklets, already in decline due to ocean warming, large-scale and persistent MHWs might represent a global population precipice.Plain Language Summary During the winter of 2014/2015, thousands of Cassin's Auklets, a small seabird that breeds in the NE Pacific, were found dead on beaches from California to British Columbia, Canada. We show that wide-scale starvation was due to a change in food quality associated with warmer ocean temperatures preceding and during the die-off.

Cloud Feedback Key to Marine Heatwave off Baja California,"Myers, TA; Mechoso, CR; Cesana, GV; DeFlorio, MJ; Waliser, DE","Between 2013 and 2015, the northeast Pacific Ocean experienced the warmest surface temperature anomalies in the modern observational record. This ""marine heatwave"" marked a shift of Pacific decadal variability to its warm phase and was linked to significant impacts on marine species as well as exceptionally arid conditions in western North America. Here we show that the subtropical signature of this warming, off Baja California, was associated with a record deficit in the spatial coverage of co-located marine boundary layer clouds. This deficit coincided with a large increase in downwelling solar radiation that dominated the anomalous energy budget of the upper ocean, resulting in record-breaking warm sea surface temperature anomalies. Our observation-based analysis suggests that a positive cloud-surface temperature feedback was key to the extreme intensity of the heatwave. The results demonstrate the extent to which boundary layer clouds can contribute to regional variations in climate.Plain Language Summary The northeast Pacific Ocean experienced a ""marine heatwave"" between 2013 and 2015. This was characterized by the highest surface temperatures ever recorded in a vast swath of the ocean from near the Gulf of Alaska to off the coast of Baja California. The unprecedented warming event was linked to significant impacts on marine life and a severe drought in western North America. We analyze satellite data to show that the heatwave was associated with a record decrease in the typically high cloudiness over an area of the Pacific off Baja California that is roughly half the size of the contiguous United States. Such a deficit in cloud cover coincided with a large increase in the amount of sunlight absorbed by the ocean surface, resulting in extremely warm temperatures.

Column-Compound Extremes in the Global Ocean,"Wong, J; Münnich, M; Gruber, N","Marine extreme events such as marine heatwaves, ocean acidity extremes and low oxygen extremes can pose a substantial threat to marine organisms and ecosystems. Such extremes might be particularly detrimental (a) when they are compounded in more than one stressor, and (b) when the extremes extend substantially across the water column, restricting the habitable space for marine organisms. Here, we use daily output of a hindcast simulation (1961-2020) from the ocean component of the Community Earth System Model to characterize such column-compound extreme events (CCX), employing a relative threshold approach to identify extremes and requiring them to extend vertically over at least 50 m. The diagnosed CCX are prevalent, occupying worldwide in the 1960s about 1% of the volume contained within the top 300 m. Over the duration of our simulation, CCX become more intense, last longer, and occupy more volume, driven by the trends in ocean warming and ocean acidification. For example, the triple CCX expanded 39-fold, now last 3-times longer, and became 6-times more intense since the early 1960s. Removing this effect with a moving baseline permits us to better understand the key characteristics of CCX, revealing a typical duration of 10-30 days and a predominant occurrence in the Tropics and high latitudes, regions of high potential biological vulnerability. Overall, the CCX fall into 16 clusters, reflecting different patterns and drivers. Triple CCX are largely confined to the tropics and the North Pacific and tend to be associated with the El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation.The global ocean is becoming warmer, more acidic, and losing oxygen due to climate change. On top of this trend, sudden increases in temperature, or drops in pH or oxygen adversely affect marine organisms when they cannot quickly adapt to these extreme conditions. These conditions are worse for marine organisms when such extremes occur together in the vertical water column, leading to column-compound extreme (CCX) events, severely reducing the available habitable space. To investigate such CCX, we used a numerical model simulation of the global ocean during the historical period of 1961-2020. Singular extreme events are identified primarily with relative percentile thresholds, while CCX require a 50 m minimum depth threshold in the water column. We find that CCX have been increasing in volume, occupying up to 20% of the global ocean volume toward 2020. We then remove the climate trend to better understand the drivers behind CCX. Many CCX occur in the tropics and high latitudes, lasting 10-30 days and reducing habitable space by up to 75%. This study is the first to systematically detect compound extremes in the water column and may form the basis for determining their detrimental effects on marine organisms and ecosystems.Column-compound extremes (CCX)- extremes in multiple parameters within the top 300 m-may reduce habitable space by up to 75% From 1961 to 2020, CCX have become more intense, longer, and occupy more volume, driven by the trends in ocean warming and acidification Triple CCX are confined to the tropics and the North Pacific and tend to be associated with ENSO",2024,,AGU ADVANCES,5,3,,WOS:001229539000001,10.1029/2023AV001059,,#276,Wong 2024,"Rob Suryan (2025-10-17 06:28:00)(Select): Modeling study, hindcast, 1961-2020, provides insight into mechanisms and spatial variability of compound extreme events.

However, heatwaves vary in intensity and evolution, and a paucity of information on how this variability impacts marine species limits our ability to proactively manage for these extreme events. Here, we model the effects of four recent heatwaves (2014, 2015, 2019, 2020) in the Northeastern Pacific on the distributions of 14 top predator species of ecological, cultural, and commercial importance. Predicted responses were highly variable across species and heatwaves, ranging from near total loss of habitat to a two-fold increase. Heatwaves rapidly altered political bio-geographies, with up to 10% of predicted habitat across all species shifting jurisdictions during individual heatwaves. The variability in predicted responses across species and heatwaves portends the need for novel management solutions that can rapidly respond to extreme climate events.

Intraseasonal relationship of winter temperatures in North America and warm sea surface temperatures in the Northeast Pacific,"Zhang, YJ; Shi, J; Chen, YX; Huang, F","Winter temperatures in the North America (NA) exhibit evident intraseasonal variation, which has become more pronounced under global climate change. In particular, the wintertime relationship between NA temperatures and long-lasting positive sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the Northeast Pacific (NEP), known as warm blobs, has been hotly debated in recent years. However, their relationship on intraseasonal timescales remains unclear. Using reanalysis data and an Atmospheric General Circulation Model, this study reveals that the intraseasonal variation of atmospheric circulation is the primary factor to induce intraseasonal temperature anomalies in NA after classifying warm SSTA events based on their different evolutions. Moreover, the atmospheric circulation anomalies over the mid-to-high-latitude regions are in part contributed by the feedback of NEP warm SSTAs to the atmosphere. Specifically, for early-winter warm SSTA events (peaking in November), there are two intraseasonal reversals in geopotential height anomalies over the NEP and NA, corresponding to a ""cold-warm-cold"" temperature change in NA. However, for mid-winter warm SSTA events (peaking in January), the atmospheric circulation pattern is relatively stable, mainly characterized by a ""west high-east low"" dipole, associated with persistent cold anomalies in NA. Then, the role of warm SSTAs over the NEP in the intraseasonal temperature variation is generally verified by the numerical simulations. Hence, although the NEP warm SSTAs may not be the dominant driver of the intraseasonal variations of winter NA temperatures, we emphasize the implication of their evolutionary differences in reflecting the NA temperature variations, which contributes to better predictability.",2025,,ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH,313,,,WOS:001356488600001,10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107773,,#281,Zhang 2025,"KAREN HUNTER (2025-10-29 07:18:33)(Select): As I understand it, this paper is exploring atmospheric patterns that leads to climate anomalies that link to NP warm blobs.

Using very high-resolution satellite imagery to map kelp forests over two decades, we present the spatial changes in kelp forest area within the Salish Sea, before (2002 to 2013) and after (2014 to 2022) the 'Blob,' an anomalously warm period in the Northeast Pacific. This analysis was spatially constrained by local environmental conditions. Based on nearshore sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from four decades (1984-2022), we found two periods of distinct increases in SST, one starting in 2000 and another in 2014. Further, the highest SST anomalies occurred on warmer coastlines in the enclosed inlets and the Strait of Georgia, while smaller anomalies were found on colder coastlines near the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Discovery Passage. The total area of bull kelp forests from 2014 to 2022 has decreased compared to 2002 to 2013, particularly in the northern sector of the Salish Sea. Using the satellite-derived kelp data, we also present an analysis of kelp persistence compared with historical distribution of kelp forests depicted on British Admiralty Nautical Charts from 1858 to 1956. This analysis shows that warm, sheltered areas experienced a considerable decrease in persistence of kelp beds when compared to satellite-derived distribution of modern kelp, confirming a century-scale loss. In particular, the presence of kelp forests in the Strait of Georgia and on the warmest coasts has decreased considerably over the century, likely due to warming temperatures. While the coldest coasts to the south have maintained their centennial persistence, the northern Salish Sea requires further research to understand its current dynamics. This research contributes to a wider understanding of temporal and spatial factors for kelp from the regional perspective of the Salish Sea.",2024,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,11,,,WOS:001325588000001,10.3389/fmars.2024.1446380,,#283,Mora-Soto 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Spatial and temporal diving behavior of non-breeding common murres during two summers of contrasting ocean conditions,"Loredo, SA; Orben, RA; Suryan, RM; Lyons, DE; Adams, J; Stephensen, SW","Successful foraging of marine predators depends on environmental conditions, which also influence prey availability. Neutral or negative El Nino Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation ocean conditions during the summer of 2013 and strongly positive conditions during the summer of 2015 in the northern California Current System provided a case study to evaluate a marine predator's response to anomalously warm conditions. We used satellite transmitters with saltwater switches to track movements and estimate dive behavior among non-breeding common murres (Uria aalge) off Oregon prior to and during a marine heatwave. We quantified differences in space-use between years, applied linear mixed models to determine environmental influences (e.g. sea surface temperature, surface salinity, chlorophyll a, ocean depth, and calendar date) on dive frequency and dive duration, and contrasted dive activity between time of day, year, and sexes. The majority of birds dispersed away from capture locations, which were situated near the southern range limit of their population. In both years, murres used the Salish Sea and the Columbia River plume; however, murres spent more time foraging in the Columbia River plume and in continental slope habitat during the marine heatwave of 2015. During 2015, dive frequency was reduced, and dive durations were almost twice as long during daytime indicating deeper or more dispersed prey. Increased dive frequency was positively associated with temperature, chlorophyll a, and crepuscular periods. Cluster analysis of dive activity and the top-ranked predictive dive duration model revealed associations between longer-duration dives and decreased dive frequency, marine slope habitat, and cooler ocean temperatures. Murres were relatively inactive throughout the night and we found no sex differences in dive activity. Changes in common murre foraging tactics were associated with ocean warming and revealed selectivity in spatial and temporal use of foraging habitats. Productive marine features including the Columbia River plume provided refuge for murres during apparently poor ocean conditions associated with the marine heatwave. Identifying refuge areas used by highly mobile species experiencing varying ocean conditions is critical for adaptive marine spatial planning that can accommodate a changing ocean climate.",2019,,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,517,,13-24,WOS:000475998800002,10.1016/j.jembe.2019.05.009,,#284,Loredo 2019,"",ecosystem response; heatwave

Capelin (Mallotus catervarius), sand lance (Ammodytes personatus), and herring (Clupea pallasii) populations were at historically low levels, and within this community abrupt declines in portfolio effects identify trophic instability at the onset of the heatwave. Although compensatory changes in age structure, size, growth or energy content of forage fish were observed to varying degrees among all these forage fish, none were able to fully mitigate adverse impacts of the heatwave, which likely included both top-down and bottom-up forcing. Notably, changes to the demographic structure of forage fish suggested size-selective removals typical of top-down regulation. At the same time, changes in zooplankton communities may have driven bottom-up regulation as copepod community structure shifted toward smaller, warm water species, and euphausiid biomass was reduced owing to the loss of cold-water species. Mediated by these impacts on the forage fish community, an unprecedented disruption of the normal pelagic food web was signaled by higher trophic level disruptions during 2015-2016, when seabirds, marine mammals, and groundfish experienced shifts in distribution, mass mortalities, and reproductive failures. Unlike decadal-scale variability underlying ecosystem regime shifts, the heatwave appeared to temporarily overwhelm the ability of the forage fish community to buffer against changes imposed by warm water anomalies, thereby eliminating any ecological advantages that may have accrued from having a suite of coexisting forage species with differing life-history compensations.",2021,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,27,9,1859-1878,WOS:000625678800001,10.1111/gcb.15556,,#285,Arimitsu 2021,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Widespread shifts in the coastal biota of northern California during the 2014-2016 marine heatwaves,"Sanford, E; Sones, JL; García-Reyes, M; Goddard, JHR; Largier, JL","During 2014-2016, severe marine heatwaves in the northeast Pacific triggered well-documented disturbances including mass mortalities, harmful algal blooms, and declines in subtidal kelp beds. However, less attention has been directed towards understanding how changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and alongshore currents during this period influenced the geographic distribution of coastal taxa. Here, we examine these effects in northern California, USA, with a focus on the region between Point Reyes and Point Arena. This region represents an important biogeographic transition zone that lies < 150 km north of Monterey Bay, California, where numerous southern species have historically reached their northern (poleward) range limits. We report substantial changes in geographic distributions and/or abundances across a diverse suite of 67 southern species, including an unprecedented number of poleward range extensions (37) and striking increases in the recruitment of owl limpets (Lottia gigantea) and volcano barnacles (Tetraclita rubescens). These ecological responses likely arose through the combined effects of extreme SST, periods of anomalous poleward flow, and the unusually long duration of heatwave events. Prolonged marine heatwaves and enhanced poleward dispersal may play an important role in longer-term shifts in the composition of coastal communities in northern California and other biogeographic transition zones.",2019,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,9,,,WOS:000460922200052,10.1038/s41598-019-40784-3,,#286,Sanford 2019,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Large-Scale Conditions for the Record-Setting Southern California Marine Heatwave of August 2018,"Wei, XY; Li, KY; Kilpatrick, T; Wang, MY; Xie, SP","In early August 2018, a record-setting marine heatwave (MHW) occurred along the coast of Southern and Baja California. Water temperature at Scripps Pier rose to 26.4 degrees C, the highest in 102 years of measurements. This paper investigates the large-scale ocean-atmospheric conditions for this Southern California MHW event. This intense and sustained event is the result of the superposition of ""weather"" timescale warming by a coastal wind relaxation and intraseasonal warming by coastally trapped waves. For weather-scale warming, climatological upwelling was weakened by a wind relaxation, due to anomalous offshore low pressure associated with passing tropical cyclones John and Kristy. For intraseasonal warming, the upwelling was inhibited and the thermocline was deepened by poleward-propagating coastally trapped waves, which provided a slow warming background. The mixed layer heat budget analysis indicates that the reduced upwelling and deepened thermocline are the major cause of the MHW.Plain Language SummaryThe Southern California marine heatwave in August 2018, which set a record for warmest sea surface temperature ever recorded at San Diego, encompasses two timescales. ""Slow"" warming began due to an earlier coastal wind relaxation, which reduced the upwelling of cool water; and the propagation of coastally trapped waves.

Studies of heatwaves provide crucial insights into potential ecosystem shifts under future climate change and put fisheries social-ecological systems through ""stress tests"" that expose both vulnerabilities and resilience. The 2014-16 Northeast Pacific heatwave was the strongest and longest marine heatwave on record and resulted in profound ecological changes that impacted fisheries, fisheries management, and human livelihoods. Here, we synthesize the impacts of the 2014-2016 marine heatwave on US and Canada West Coast fisheries and extract key lessons for preparing global fisheries science, management, and industries for the future. We set the stage with a brief review of the impacts of the heatwave on marine ecosystems and the first systematic analysis of the economic impacts of these changes on commercial and recreational fisheries. We then examine ten key case studies that provide instructive examples of the complex and surprising challenges that heatwaves pose to fisheries social-ecological systems. These reveal important insights into improving the resilience of monitoring and management and increasing adaptive capacity to future stressors. Key recommendations include: (1) expanding monitoring to enhance mechanistic understanding, provide early warning signals, and improve predictions of impacts; (2) increasing the flexibility, adaptiveness, and inclusiveness of management where possible; (3) using simulation testing to help guide management decisions; and (4) enhancing the adaptive capacity of fishing communities by promoting engagement, flexibility, experimentation, and failsafes.

The Continuum of Northeast Pacific Marine Heatwaves and Their Relationship to the Tropical Pacific,"Xu, TT; Newman, M; Capotondi, A; Di Lorenzo, E","Some questions remain concerning the record-breaking 2013-2015 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave (MHW) event: was it exceptional or merely the most pronounced of a group of similar events, and was its intensity and multiyear duration driven by internal extratropical processes or did the tropics play an important role? By analyzing the statistical behavior of the historical MHWs within the ERSST.v3 data set over the 1950-2019 period, we find that Northeast Pacific MHWs occurred over a continuum of intensities and durations, suggesting that these events are a recurrent Pacific phenomenon. These statistics and corresponding composite evolution are dynamically reproduced by a large ensemble simulation of a Pacific Linear Inverse Model, thereby providing a greater range of MHW expressions than the short observational record alone. Consistent with the 2013-2015 event's evolution, we find that overall the tropics influence MHWs primarily by increasing their duration, while MHW intensity is related to the initial extratropical anomalies.Plain Language Summary Marine heatwaves (MHWs), analogous to heatwaves on land, describe when the ocean temperature is abnormally warm for a prolonged period. In the Northeast Pacific during 2013-2015, an exceptionally strong and long-lasting MHW occurred causing destructive ecosystem impacts including massive mortality of fish and birds. Given the unusual nature of the event, it is of considerable interest to ask whether it occurred largely naturally or whether it might have been impacted by climate change. To address this question, we analyze historical MHWs over the 1950-2019 period and, since there may have been too few observed MHWs for comprehensive scientific understanding, additionally construct a statistical model mimicking how Pacific ocean surface temperatures evolve over time. In this manner, we create 2,000 ""alternate histories"" of what could have happened over the 1950-2019 period to provide enough MHWs for further analysis. Our findings suggest that Northeast Pacific MHWs are an irregularly recurring natural phenomenon, whose duration is largely dependent on interactions with the remote tropical Pacific but whose intensity depends primarily on local conditions within the North Pacific. A 2013-2015 event could well have occurred without climate change, but our model cannot entirely anticipate its prolonged severity.Key Points.Prolonged and intense marine heatwaves (MHWs) are a recurrent Northeast Pacific phenomenon, well captured by a simple Linear Inverse ModelNortheast Pacific MHW duration appears greatly affected by tropical interactions, while MHW intensity stems primarily from the extratropicsThe 2013-2015 Northeast Pacific MHW was an extreme example of this phenomenon that may have been further strengthened by climate change",2021,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,48,2,,WOS:000613648800039,10.1029/2020GL090661,,#291,Xu 2021,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Breeding success of short-tailed shearwaters following extreme environmental conditions,"Glencross, JS; Lavers, JL; Woehler, EJ","Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency, causing disruption to global ecosystems. Large-scale events, such as marine heatwaves, can impact the abundance of prey species, which consequently influences the behaviour of top-level predators such as seabirds. The short-tailed shearwater Ardenna tenuirostris is a trans-hemispheric migrant with typically a highly synchronous breeding phenology. Here, we document short-tailed shearwater colony occupancy for the period 2011-2020, with a focussed assessment of their breeding success in the 2019/20 season, which followed a marine heatwave that occurred predominantly in the nonbreeding areas in the North Pacific Ocean. The return of the birds to their breeding colonies in southeast Australia was delayed by approximately 2 wk in October 2019, and the subsequent breeding season ended with only 34% breeding success, with nest abandonment beginning in the incubation phase. A North Pacific marine heatwave in 2019, associated with a mass mortality event of over 9000 birds ('wreck' of beach-washed birds), led to reduced adult body condition and carry-over effects causing egg and chick failures during the subsequent breeding season. Localised weather events (i.e. flooding of burrows due to heavy rainfall) also influenced breeding outcomes of the 2019/20 season. The relationship between wreck events and seabird breeding ecology is an understudied area, partly due to the difficulties around quantifying the scale of wrecks. Our study is one of few that documents poor seabird breeding success following the extreme marine conditions which have persisted in the North Pacific Ocean since 2013.",2021,,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,672,,193-203,WOS:000691315800014,10.3354/meps13791,,#293,Glencross 2021,"",GLOBAL; ecosystem response; heatwave
Regime shifts in rocky intertidal communities associated with a marine heatwave and disease outbreak,"Meunier, ZD; Hacker, SD; Menge, BA","Long-term, large-scale experimental studies provide critical information about how global change influences communities. When environmental changes are severe, they can trigger abrupt transitions from one community type to another leading to a regime shift. From 2014 to 2016, rocky intertidal habitats in the northeast Pacific Ocean experienced extreme temperatures during a multi-year marine heatwave (MHW) and sharp population declines of the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus due to sea star wasting disease (SSWD). Here we measured the community structure before, during and after the MHW onset and SSWD outbreak in a 15-year succession experiment conducted in a rocky intertidal meta-ecosystem spanning 13 sites on four capes in Oregon and northern California, United States. Kelp abundance declined during the MHW due to extreme temperatures, while gooseneck barnacle and mussel abundances increased due to reduced predation pressure after the loss of Pisaster from SSWD. Using several methods, we detected regime shifts from substrate- or algae-dominated to invertebrate-dominated alternative states at two capes. After water temperatures cooled and Pisaster population densities recovered, community structure differed from pre-disturbance conditions, suggesting low resilience. Consequently, thermal stress and predator loss can result in regime shifts that fundamentally alter community structure even after restoration of baseline conditions.A 15-year experiment at rocky intertidal sites on the northwestern US coast documents kelp, barnacle and mussel abundances before, during and after a multi-year marine heatwave and an outbreak of sea star wasting disease, including changes to communities that did not recover after return to baseline conditions.",2024,,NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,,,,WOS:001238205000002,10.1038/s41559-024-02425-5,,#294,Meunier 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Two Marine Heatwave (MHW) Variants under a Basinwide MHW Conditioning Mode in the North Pacific and Their Atlantic Associations,"Zhao, Y; Yu, JY","During 2013-16 and 2018-22, marine heatwaves (MHWs) occurred in the North Pacific, exhibiting similar extensive coverage, lengthy duration, and significant intensity but with different warming centers. The warming center of the 2013-16 event was in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), while the 2018-22 event had warming centers in both the GOA and the coast of Japan (COJ). Our observational analysis indicates that these two events can be considered as two MHW variants induced by a basinwide MHW conditioning mode in the North Pacific. Both variants were driven thermodynamically by atmospheric wave trains propagating from the tropical Pacific to the North Pacific, within the conditioning mode. The origin and propagating path of these wave trains play a crucial role in determining the specific type of MHW variant. When a stronger wave train originates from the tropical central (western) Pacific, it leads to the GOA (COJ) variant. The cross-basin nature of the wave trains enables the two MHWvariants to be accompanied by a tripolar pattern of sea surface temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic but with opposite phases. The association of these two MHW variants with the Atlantic Ocean also manifests in the decadal variations of their occurrence. Both variants tend to occur more frequently during the positive phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation but less so during the negative phase. This study underscores the importance of cross-basin associations between the North Pacific and North Atlantic in shaping the dynamics of North Pacific MHWs.",2023,,JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,36,24,8657-8674,WOS:001177275900001,10.1175/JCLI-D-23-0156.s1,,#296,Zhao 2023,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Record-Breaking Marine Heatwave over the Central North Pacific in 2021 Summer: Its Formation Associated with Loss of Central Mode Water,"Nishihira, G; Sugimoto, S","Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged extremely high sea surface temperature (SST) events. In the 2021 summer, an intense MHW occurred over the central North Pacific; the SST in September 2021 was the highest in September since 1900, and the warming signal was distributed not only near the sea surface but also below the ocean mixed layer (similar to 300-m depth). Atmosphere reanalysis data showed westward expansion of the North Pacific subtropical high (NPSH) in the 2021 summer, but both an increase in downward shortwave radiation and a decrease in upward latent heat flux were not so large, and ocean mixed layer heat budget analysis, which also used ocean reanalysis data, revealed that the atmosphere-induced heating is insufficient to form the record-breaking MHW. Argo profiling floats indicated that, in the 2021 summer, the Central Mode Water (CMW)-a huge water mass characterized by vertically uniform properties in depths of 100-500 m-decreased extremely, the thickness of which was less than 20% of the normal. Statistical analysis showed that, from the sea surface to the upper boundary of CMW, the heavier isopycnal surfaces are deeper associated with the decrease in CMW, leading to a weakening of the seasonal pycnocline. Then, this causes the weakening of cooling heat flux associated with the entrainment of subsurface waters into the mixed layer, resulting in surface ocean warming, which in turn contributed to form the MHW in the 2021 summer.",2024,,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY,54,11,2361-2372,WOS:001359405500001,10.1175/JPO-D-24-0021.1,,#297,Nishihira 2024,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Impacts of extreme ocean warming on the early development of a marine top predator: The Guadalupe fur seal,"Gálvez, C; Pardo, MA; Elorriaga-Verplancken, FR","From fall 2013 through 2015, a large-scale, multi-year warm water anomaly occurred in the northeast Pacific Ocean. The phenomenon had negative impacts on some oceanic predators, including higher mortalities and poor body conditions. We studied the effect of this warm water anomaly on the weight gain of Guadalupe fur seal (Arctocephalus philippii townsendi) neonates off the coast of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. Individuals were captured, marked, and weighed every 13-15 days, up to 60 days of age, during the early nursing seasons (mid-June to mid-August) of 2014-2016 at this subspecies' only reproductive colony, located on Guadalupe Island. The body weight was measured at each capture and recapture. A hierarchical Bayesian model was used to explore the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies on the neonates' weights. The hierarchical structure included connected models for the spring-summer SST trend around the colony, the neonatal body weight g`ain with age, and the relationship between the anomalies of both variables. Marked neonates were also tracked in order to estimate survival rates during first two months of age. Overall, positive SST anomalies had a negative effect on neonatal body weight gain. The northeast Pacific Marine Heatwave precipitated the lowest weights at birth and the slowest weight gain in 2014, as well as low weights and the lowest survival rate in 2015, likely due to the persistence of the warm anomalies. The evident sensitivity of Guadalupe fur seal neonates to regional warming conditions highlights their vulnerability under scenarios of climate change, which could impede this subspecies' continued recovery from near extinction.",2020,,PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY,180,,,WOS:000510110700003,10.1016/j.pocean.2019.102220,,#298,Gálvez 2020,"",economic impact; heatwave
Effects of a marine heatwave on adult body length of three numerically dominant krill species in the California Current Ecosystem,"Killeen, H; Dorman, J; Sydeman, W; Dibble, C; Morgan, S","Krill are an abundant and globally distributed forage taxon in marine ecosystems, including the California Current Ecosystem (CCE). The role of krill in trophodynamics depends on both abundance and size (biomass), but the impact of extreme climate events on krill body size is poorly understood. Using samples collected from 2011 to 2018, we tested the hypotheses that adult body length of three krill species (Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera, and Nematoscelis difficilis) declined during the 2014-2016 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave/El Nino event due to elevated seawater temperatures, reduced upwelling, and low primary productivity. Hierarchical mixed-effects modelling showed that mean length of adult E. pacifica and T. spinifera declined and N. difficilis length increased during 2015. These trends differed by sex and reverted to a pre-heatwave state in 2016. Temperature, upwelling, and food availability (chlorophyll-a content) did not explain decreased length in 2015, but environmental drivers of length varied regionally and by sex across all years.

Roles of External Forcing and Internal Variability in Global Marine Heatwaves Change During 1982-2021,"Dong, L; Zeng, SJ; Song, FF; Wu, LX; Shi, J; Ding, Y; Lv, SX","As discrete prolonged extreme warm water events, marine heatwaves (MHWs) have become more frequent, stronger and longer-lasting during the past several decades. The relative contributions of external forcing and internal variability to these changes and their underlying drivers remain unclear. Here, analyses of 90 simulations in CESM2 reveal that external forcing dominates the increasing frequency by causing the mean warming of sea surface temperature (SST), accounting for 82% of the observed trends. Both the mean warming and increased variance of SST contribute to the longer-lasting MHWs during 1982-2021, with external forcing contributing 38% of the increase in the SST variance for global average. Internal variability, especially the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), is closely associated with regional MHW changes. The observed negative IPO trend during 1982-2021 is related to increasing, strengthening and longer-lasting MHW over Kuroshio Extension, but decreasing and shorter-lasting MHW over the Northeast Pacific Coast.Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are discrete prolonged extreme warm water events, with devastating and profound impacts on the health of marine ecosystems and biological systems. During the past several decades, MHWs have become more frequent, stronger, and longer-lasting. Both external forcing and internal variability have been argued to play important roles in these changes, but their relative contributions are still largely unknown. Here, we use the large ensemble simulations from CESM2 with a total of 90 members to identify the role of external forcing and internal variability in the global MHW changes. It is found that external forcing dominates the increasing MHW frequency, accounting for 82% of the observed global averaged increase during 1982-2021. This increase is mainly caused by the mean SST warming. In addition to the rising mean SST, the increased SST variance also plays a role in the longer-lasting MHWs. However, the MHW intensity change is dominated by the internal variability via the SST variance change. In particular, the IPO is closely associated with the MHW changes in Kuroshio Extension and Northeast Pacific Coast. These findings underscore the importance of considering both external forcing and internal variability in predicting and projecting the MHW change in the future.External forcing dominates the increasing frequency of marine heatwave (MHW), accounting for 82% of the observed global averaged increase during 1982-2021 Mean warming and the increased sea surface temperature variance contribute to the longer-lasting MHWs during 1982-2021 Internal variability, especially the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation, is closely related to the MHW changes in Kuroshio Extension and Northeast Pacific Coast",2024,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,51,4,,WOS:001177318400027,10.1029/2023GL107557,,#301,Dong 2024,"",heatwave; physical drivers

A marine heatwave formed in the north Pacific in 2019 and reached the second greatest area ever recorded by the end of summer 2020. However, high atmospheric pressure in early 2020 drove relatively strong Ekman-driven coastal upwelling in the northern portion of the CCS and warm temperature anomalies remained far offshore. Upwelling and cooler temperatures in the northern CCS created relatively productive conditions in which the biomass of lipid-rich copepod species increased, adult krill size increased, and several seabird species experienced positive reproductive success. Despite these conditions, the composition of the fish community in the northern CCS remained a mixture of both warm- and cool-water-associated species. In the southern CCS, ocean temperatures remained above average for the seventh consecutive year. Abundances of juvenile fish species associated with productive conditions were relatively low, and the ichthyoplankton community was dominated by a mixture of oceanic warm-water and cosmopolitan species.

Their breeding habitat is restricted to Guadalupe Island, Mexico, which is vulnerable to periodic and cyclic warming of the Northeast Pacific Ocean. The impacts of environmental change on GFS health and reproductive success at Guadalupe Island are poorly defined and the aim of this study was to establish baseline pup (GFSn) mortality rates and primary causes of death during the 2013-2016 breeding seasons at Guadalupe Island. Interannual mortality rates and causes of death were compared by year, breeding seasons and by geographic location. The highest mortality rate in GFSn was in 2015 (14.7%), followed by 2014 (8.2%), 2016 (6.7%) and 2013 (5.6%). The presumptive causes of mortality of GFSn were consistent with other published long term otariids health surveys and included: emaciation (49%), trauma (24%), infectious disease (8%), drowning (4%) stillbirth/perinatal mortality (4%) and undetermined (11%). However, in 2015 and coinciding with northeast Pacific marine heatwave in 2014-2016, emaciation accounted for 54% of GFSn mortality in contrast to 9% in 2013. For GFSn, terrestrial habitat may influence mortality rates and causes of mortality but like other marine predators, marine habitat features, such as an increase in sea surface temperature are associated with changes in maternal care, nutritional status and pups survival. Monitoring mortality rate and causes in GFSn at Guadalupe Island is crucial to establish baseline health trends, document potential impacts on species demographics and recruitment during marine heatwaves and potential consequences in population recovery.",2023,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,10,,,WOS:001054366700001,10.3389/fmars.2023.1202533,,#305,Gálvez 2023,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Marine Heatwaves in the East Asian Marginal Seas Facilitated by Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillations,"Dasgupta, P; Nam, S; Saranya, JS; Roxy, MK","During the summer of 2016, the northern East China Sea and the southern Yellow Sea (NECS-SYS) experienced one of the most severe and devastating marine heatwaves (MHWs) on record, with a temperature anomaly exceeding 4 degrees C. This shallow semi-enclosed continental shelf region is widely recognized as a significant hotspot for MHWs with associated incidences of harmful algae blooms. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of mixed layer shoaling as a crucial factor in the genesis of MHWs in the global ocean. The current study employed the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model reanalysis data set during 1994-2015 to delve into the mechanisms driving mixed layer shoaling during NECS-SYS MHW genesis. Our findings reveal the significant role of the northward propagating boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation in promoting MHW genesis and intensification. Specifically, boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation phases 5, 6, and 7 contribute to the favorable conditions that facilitate MHW formation by inducing mixed layer shoaling and increasing solar influx, with mixed layer shoaling playing a more dominant role. The current study provides insights into the relative influences of wind, salinity, and temperature on mixed layer shoaling. We observe that wind plays the most significant role in mixed layer shoaling, followed by temperature and salinity. The boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation induced wind relaxation, increased shortwave radiation, and freshwater influx lead sea surface temperature by 7, 5, and 4 days, respectively. Importantly, mixed layer shoaling leads SST anomalies by 1-2 days. Therefore, the current study also suggests an intraseasonal predictability source for NECS-SYS MHWs.The northern East China Sea and southern Yellow Sea (NECS-SYS) experienced one of the most severe and devastating marine heatwaves (MHWs) during the summer of 2016. The region, situated in the northwest Pacific, is characterized by a shallow semi-enclosed marginal sea, and receives a significant amount of freshwater influx from the Yangtze River. Previous studies have demonstrated that shoaling of surface mixed layer is a primary factor contributing to the genesis of MHWs in the global ocean. The present study emphasizes the role of the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation in creating favorable conditions for MHWs genesis in these regions. Our research demonstrates that boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation phases 5, 6, and 7 contribute to the amplification of solar flux and the shoaling of mixed layer by reducing wind speed and introducing freshwater in this region. We provide a comprehensive understanding of the individual influences of wind, salinity, and temperature on mixed layer shoaling, highlighting the significance of mixed layer shoaling as a fundamental driver of MHWs. Moreover, our research also directs to an intraseasonal predictability source of the NECS-SYS MHWs.Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation phases 5, 6, and 7 facilitate marine heatwaves (MHWs) in the northern East China Sea and southern Yellow Sea Mixed layer shoaling is a more critical factor than the enhanced shortwave for MHW genesis and intensification in this region Occurrences of MHWs in phase with boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation offer subseasonal predictability of MHWs",2024,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,129,2,,WOS:001169131400001,10.1029/2023JC020602,,#306,Dasgupta 2024,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Reduced survival of Steller sea lions in the Gulf of Alaska following marine heatwave,"Hastings, KK; Gelatt, TS; Maniscalco, JM; Jemison, LA; Towell, R; Pendleton, GW; Johnson, DS","The North Pacific marine heatwave of 2014-2016 (PMH), one of the most geographically-extensive and severe marine heatwaves on record, resulted in widespread and persistent perturbation of the Gulf of Alaska and California Current ecosystems. Negative effects of the PMH on marine mammals have been observed, but are not yet well understood. The endangered Steller sea lion Eumetopias jubatus is an important top predator in the Gulf of Alaska that is also particularly vulnerable to sudden or severe ecosystem shifts. We examined survival of 4,178 known-aged Steller sea lions marked from 2000 to 2016 from Kodiak Island through Southeast Alaska, using mark-recapture models and 12,811 resightings collected from 2001 to 2021. Survival of adult females aged 3-15 was reduced -0.05 to -0.23 during the PMH in the areas east, but not west, of Cook Inlet. Survival of Kodiak females was unaffected by the PMH, but survival of Sugarloaf females aged 5-8 was reduced -0.13 from summer 2015 to summer 2016. Lowest survival in Southeast Alaska occurred from summer 2016 to summer 2017, but was also reduced from summer 2014 to summer 2016. Reduced survival continued post-PMH in Kenai Peninsula/Prince William Sound, but not in Southeast Alaska. Survival of adult males was insensitive to the PMH, except in Southeast Alaska where male survival was reduced -0.25 from summer 2016 to summer 2017. Prolonged or intermittent high adult female mortality may reduce population growth and initiate regional declines. Survival response of Steller sea lions to the PMH varied regionally despite similar patterns of ocean warming throughout our study area, suggesting areas east versus west of Cook Inlet were affected differently by the PMH, perhaps due to habitat and oceanographic differences.",2023,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,10,,,WOS:001003533500001,10.3389/fmars.2023.1127013,,#307,Hastings 2023,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Multi-year persistence of the 2014/15 North Pacific marine heatwave,"Di Lorenzo, E; Mantua, N","Between the winters of 2013/14 and 2014/15 during the strong North American drought, the northeast Pacific experienced the largest marine heatwave ever recorded. Here we combine observations with an ensemble of climate model simulations to show that teleconnections between the North Pacific and the weak 2014/2015 El Nino linked the atmospheric forcing patterns of this event. These teleconnection dynamics from the extratropics to the tropics during winter 2013/14, and then back to the extratropics during winter 2014/15, are a key source of multi- year persistence of the North Pacific atmosphere. The corresponding ocean anomalies map onto known patterns of North Pacific decadal variability, specifically the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) in 2014 and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in 2015. A large ensemble of climate model simulations predicts that the winter variance of the NPGO- and PDO-like patterns increases under greenhouse forcing, consistent with other studies suggesting an increase in the atmospheric extremes that lead to drought over North America.",2016,,NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE,6,11,1042-+,WOS:000389428300021,10.1038/NCLIMATE3082,,#308,DiLorenzo 2016,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Resilience to a severe marine heatwave at two Pacific seabird colonies,"Wagner, EL; Pearson, SF; Good, TP; Hodum, PJ; Buhle, ER; Schrimpf, MB","A severe marine heat wave (MHW) persisted in the California Current ecosystem from 2014 through 2016. The MHW featured record-high sea surface temperatures in 2015, with 2014 to 2016 being the warmest 3 yr period on record. Our decade-long (2010-2019) breeding and diet monitoring of the rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata, a burrow-nesting seabird, at significant breeding colonies on Destruction Island (California Current) and Protection Island (Salish Sea) allowed us to compare reproductive and dietary responses to this MHW. Although the colonies are relatively close to each other, and their reproductive output is, on average, similar, the auklets' responses to the MHW differed. At Destruction Island, burrow occupancy rates were lower during the MHW (0.54 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.61 +/- 0.02 [mean +/- SE] in non-MHW years), suggesting that birds skipped breeding, but fledging success rates did not differ (0.85 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.03). At Protection Island, burrow occupancy remained at non-MHW levels (0.72 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.69 +/- 0.02), but reproductive success declined (0.71 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.82 +/- 0.02). Chick provisioning also showed different patterns. The energy (kJ) per bill load at Destruction Island showed no clear MHW effect, while at Protection Island, it was reduced. At the same time, bill-load prey item count rose at Protection Island, indicating increased foraging effort and/or a reduction in diet quality. Our results further suggest rhinoceros auklets may be more resilient than other seabird species to major climate perturbations. However, with MHWs predicted to become more frequent and severe, the auklets' ability to maintain these levels of breeding success will be tested.",2024,,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,737,,101-120,WOS:001249746900003,10.3354/meps14222,,#309,Wagner 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Global chlorophyll responses to marine heatwaves in satellite ocean color,"Noh, KM; Lim, HG; Kug, JS","Marine heatwaves (MHWs), prolonged ocean temperature extremes, have been enhanced by global warming in recent decades. More intense and longer MHWs have increasingly negative impacts on marine organisms that threaten their resilience of marine ecosystems. In this study, we investigated global marine phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll) estimated by satellite ocean color and its response to MHWs on global and regional scales. We find that MHWs typically decreases chlorophyll concentrations in the tropics and mid-latitudes, with increases at high latitudes. The magnitude of chlorophyll responses to MHWs is increased in response to higher intensity and longer duration of MHWs. We find a change in the response from negative to positive chlorophyll responses to MHWs across the 40 degrees-50 degrees latitude bands in both hemispheres where the strongest meridional gradient in nitrate concentration exists. In these response-changing regions, the latitudinal contrast of the chlorophyll response is more distinctive in the warm season rather than in the cold season because of the shallower climatological mixed layer. The present study highlights the global phytoplankton responses to MHWs and their sensitivity to MHWs properties that imply the importance of upper-ocean interactions between phytoplankton and the mixed-layer.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,17,6,,WOS:000806531800001,10.1088/1748-9326/ac70ec,,#311,Noh 2022,"KAREN HUNTER (2025-08-26 04:12:34)(Select): Global, but results are presented graphically by ocean region; ",GLOBAL; heatwave
Predictability of Species Distributions Deteriorates Under Novel Environmental Conditions in the California Current System,"Muhling, BA; Brodie, S; Smith, JA; Tommasi, D; Gaitan, CF; Hazen, EL; Jacox, MG; Auth, TD; Brodeur, RD","Spatial distributions of marine fauna are determined by complex interactions between environmental conditions and animal behaviors. As climate change leads to warmer, more acidic, and less oxygenated oceans, species are shifting away from their historical distribution ranges, and these trends are expected to continue into the future. Correlative Species Distribution Models (SDMs) can be used to project future habitat extent for marine species, with many different statistical methods available. However, it is vital to assess how different statistical methods behave under novel environmental conditions before using these models for management advice, and to consider whether future projections based on these techniques are biologically reasonable. In this study, we built SDMs for adults and larvae of two ecologically important pelagic fishes in the California Current System (CCS): Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). We used five different SDM methods, ranging from simple [thermal niche model (TNM)] to complex (artificial neural networks). Our results show that some SDMs trained on data collected between 2003 and 2013 lost substantial predictive skill when applied to observations from more recent years, when ocean temperatures associated with a marine heatwave were outside the range of historical measurements. This decrease in skill was particularly apparent for adult sardine, which showed non-stationary relationships between catch locations and sea surface temperature (SST) through time. While sardine adults and larvae shifted their distributions markedly during the marine heatwave, anchovy largely maintained their historical spatiotemporal distributions. Our results suggest that correlative relationships between species and their environment can become unreliable during anomalous conditions. Understanding the underlying physiology of marine species is therefore essential for the construction of SDMs that are robust to rapidly changing environments. Developing distribution models that offer skillful predictions into the future for species such as sardine and anchovy, which are migratory and include separate sub-stocks, may be particularly challenging.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,7,,,WOS:000556184300001,10.3389/fmars.2020.00589,,#313,Muhling 2020,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
"Unprecedented Outbreak of Harmful Algae in Pacific Coastal Waters off Southeast Hokkaido, Japan, during Late Summer 2021 after Record-Breaking Marine Heatwaves","Kuroda, H; Azumaya, T; Setou, T; Hasegawa, N","Unprecedented large-scale harmful algae blooms (HABs) were reported in coastal waters off the south-eastern coast of Hokkaido, Japan, in mid-to-late September 2021, about a month after very intense and extensive marine heatwaves subsided. To understand the physical-biological processes associated with development of the HABs, we conducted analyses via a combination of realistic ocean circulation models, particle-tracking simulations, and satellite measurements. The satellite-derived chlorophyll concentrations (SCCs) and areal extent of the high SCCs associated with the HABs were the highest recorded since 1998. More specifically, the extent of SCCs exceeding 5 or 10 mg m(-3) started to slowly increase after 20 August, when the marine heatwaves subsided, intermittently exceeded the climatological daily maximum after late August, and reached record-breaking extremes in mid-to-late September. About 70% of the SCCs that exceeded 10 mg m(-3) occurred in places where water depths were <300 m, i.e., coastal shelf waters. The high SCCs were also tightly linked with low-salinity water (e.g., subarctic Oyashio and river-influenced waters). High-salinity subtropical water (e.g., Soya Warm Current water) appeared to suppress the occurrence of HABs. The expansion of the area of high SCCs seemed to be synchronized with the deepening of surface mixed layer depths in subarctic waters on the Pacific shelves. That deepening began around 10 August, when the marine heatwaves weakened abruptly. However, another mechanism was needed to explain the intensification of the SCCs in very nearshore waters off southeast Hokkaido. Particle-tracking simulations based on ocean circulation models identified three potential source areas of the HABs: the Pacific Ocean east of the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Sea of Japan, and the Sea of Okhotsk east of the Sakhalin Island. Different processes of HAB development were proposed because distance, time, and probability for transport of harmful algae from the potential source areas to the study region differed greatly between the three source areas.",2021,,JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,9,12,,WOS:000745265700001,10.3390/jmse9121335,,#315,Kuroda 2021,"",""
Marine heatwaves suppress ocean circulation and large vortices in the Gulf of Alaska,"De Malibran, MCR; Kaplan, CM; Di Lorenzo, E","Large-scale anticyclonic vortices forming along the Gulf of Alaska continental slope serve as fertile ecosystems for marine life, significantly shaping the distribution of primary productivity, with 40-80% of the gulf's open ocean surface chlorophyll-a concentrated in their cores. Between 2013 and 2023, Alaska experienced some of the largest and longest marine heatwaves ever recorded in the world's oceans, persistently altering its ecosystem and fisheries. Here, using 30 years of satellite and reanalysis data, we find that the coastal upwelling atmospheric forcing conditions associated with the heatwaves have also significantly suppressed the Gulf of Alaska's ocean circulation and the formation of large anticyclones. Climate model simulations spanning from 1850 to 2100 suggest that future changes in the Aleutian Low pressure system will lead to a 60% increase in upwelling extremes (>2 standard deviations), further weakening the ocean anticyclones. However, large uncertainties remain in the mechanisms controlling the Aleutian Low's response to climate forcing in the models.",2024,,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,5,1,,WOS:001342225000007,10.1038/s43247-024-01785-x,,#316,DeMalibran 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Fluctuations in Hawaii's humpback whale <i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i> population inferred from male song chorusing off Maui,"Kügler, A; Lammers, MO; Zang, EJ; Kaplan, MB; Mooney, TA","Approximately half of the North Pacific humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae stock visits the shallow waters of the main Hawaiian Islands seasonally. Within this breeding area, mature males produce an elaborate acoustic display known as song, which becomes the dominant source of ambient underwater sound between December and April. Following reports of unusually low whale numbers that began in 2015/16, we examined song chorusing recorded through long-term passive acoustic monitoring at 6 sites off Maui as a proxy for relative whale abundance between 2014 and 2019. Daily root-mean-square sound pressure levels (RMS SPLs) were calculated to compare variations in low-frequency acoustic energy (0-1.5 kHz). After 2014/15, the overall RMS SPLs decreased between 5.6 and 9.7 dB re 1 mu Pa-2 during the peak of whale season (February and March), reducing ambient acoustic energy from chorusing by over 50%. This change in song levels co-occurred with a broad-scale oceanic heat wave in the northeast Pacific termed the 'Blob,' a major El Nino event in the North Pacific, and a warming period in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation cycle. Although it remains unclear whether our observations reflect a decrease in population size, a change in migration patterns, a shift in distribution to other areas, a change in the behavior of males, or some combination of these, our results indicate that continued monitoring and further studies of humpback whales throughout the North Pacific are warranted to better understand the fluctuations occurring in this recently recovered population and other populations that continue to be endangered or threatened.",2020,,ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH,43,,421-434,WOS:000619516900032,10.3354/esr01080,,#317,Kügler 2020,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Record High Sea Surface Temperatures in 2023,"Huang, BY; Yin, XA; Carton, JA; Chen, LG; Graham, G; Hogan, P; Smith, T; Zhang, HM","NOAA Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (DOISST) and other similar sea surface temperature (SST) products indicate that the globally averaged SST set a new daily record in March 2023. The record-high SST in March was immediately broken in April, and new daily records were set again in July and August 2023. The SST anomaly (SSTA) persisted at a record high from mid-March to the remainder of 2023. Our analysis indicates that the record-high SSTs, and associated marine heatwaves (MHWs) and even super-MHWs, are attributed to three factors: (a) a long-term warming trend, (b) a shift to the warm phase of the multi-decadal Pacific-Atlantic-Arctic (PAA) mode, and (c) the transition from the triple-dip succession of La Ni & ntilde;a events to the 2023-24 El Ni & ntilde;o event.Observation-based analyses such as the NOAA DOISST show that global mean SST reached a record high in April 2023, breaking the previous record of global mean SST set in March 2016, and the April 2023 record of global mean SST was broken again in July and August 2023. Our study indicates that these record-breaking SSTs in 2023 resulted from record-high SSTs over much of the global oceans and associated with widespread marine heatwaves (MHWs). Further analyses show that the record-high SSTs are attributed to a long-term-warming trend associated with increasing greenhouse gases, a shift to the warm phase of a multidecadal Pacific-Atlantic-Arctic (PAA) mode, and a warming associated with the transition from 2020-23 La Ni & ntilde;a events to the 2023-24 El Ni & ntilde;o event.Global mean sea surface temperature (SST) in 2023 set a record high Record-high SST was associated with widespread marine heatwaves (MHWs) and super-MHWs throughout the oceans Record-high SST was attributed to the multi-decadal warming trend, warm phase of Pacific-Atlantic-Arctic mode, and 2023-24 El Ni & ntilde;o event",2024,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,51,14,,WOS:001275738700001,10.1029/2024GL108369,,#319,Huang 2024,"",GLOBAL; physical drivers
Responses of ichthyoplankton assemblages to the recent marine heatwave and previous climate fluctuations in several Northeast Pacific marine ecosystems,"Nielsen, JM; Rogers, LA; Brodeur, RD; Thompson, AR; Auth, TD; Deary, AL; Duffy-Anderson, JT; Galbraith, M; Koslow, JA; Perry, RI","The effects of climate warming on ecosystem dynamics are widespread throughout the world's oceans. In the Northeast Pacific, large-scale climate patterns such as the El Nino/Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and recently unprecedented warm ocean conditions from 2014 to 2016, referred to as a marine heatwave (MHW), resulted in large-scale ecosystem changes. Larval fishes quickly respond to environmental variability and are sensitive indicators of ecosystem change. Categorizing ichthyoplankton dynamics across marine ecosystem in the Northeast Pacific can help elucidate the magnitude of assemblage shifts, and whether responses are synchronous or alternatively governed by local responses to regional oceanographic conditions. We analyzed time-series data of ichthyoplankton abundances from four ecoregions in the Northeast Pacific ranging from subarctic to subtropical: the Gulf of Alaska (1981-2017), British Columbia (2001-2017), Oregon (1998-2017), and the southern California Current (1981-2017). We assessed the impact of the recent (2014-2016) MHW and how ichthyoplankton assemblages responded to past major climate perturbations since 1981 in these ecosystems. Our results indicate that the MHW caused widespread changes in the ichthyoplankton fauna along the coast of the Northeast Pacific Ocean, but impacts differed between marine ecosystems. For example, abundances for most dominant taxa were at all-time lows since the beginning of sampling in the Gulf of Alaska and British Columbia, while in Oregon and the southern California Current species richness increased as did abundances of species associated with warmer waters. Lastly, species associated with cold waters also increased in abundances close to shore in southern California during the MHW, a pattern that was distinctly different from previous El Nino events. We also found several large-scale, synchronized ichthyoplankton assemblage composition shifts during past major climate events. Current climate projections suggest that MHWs will become more intense and thus our findings can help project future changes in larval dynamics, allowing for improved ecosystem management decisions.",2021,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,27,3,506-520,WOS:000597640500001,10.1111/gcb.15415,,#320,Nielsen 2021,"",ecosystem response; heatwave

Theory on range expansions distinguishes between two different forms: ""pulled"" and ""pushed"" waves. Pulled waves occur when the source of the expansion comes from low-density peripheral populations, while pushed waves occur when recruitment to the expanding edge is supplied by high-density populations closer to the species' core. How extreme events shape pushed/pulled wave expansion events, as well as trailing-edge declines/contractions, remains largely unexplored. We examined eco-evolutionary responses of a marine invertebrate (the owl limpet, Lottia gigantea) that increased in abundance during the 2014-2016 marine heatwaves near the poleward edge of its geographic range in the northeastern Pacific. We used whole-genome sequencing from 19 populations across >11 degrees of latitude to characterize genomic variation, gene flow, and demographic histories across the species' range. We estimated present-day dispersal potential and past climatic stability to identify how contemporary and historical seascape features shape genomic characteristics. Consistent with expectations of a pushed wave, we found little genomic differentiation between core and leading-edge populations, and higher genomic diversity at range edges. A large and well-mixed population in the northern edge of the species' range is likely a result of ocean current anomalies increasing larval settlement and high-dispersal potential across biogeographic boundaries. Trailing-edge populations have higher differentiation from core populations, possibly driven by local selection and limited gene flow, as well as high genomic diversity likely as a result of climatic stability during the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings suggest that extreme events can drive poleward range expansions that carry the adaptive potential of core populations, while also cautioning that trailing-edge extirpations may threaten unique evolutionary variation. This work highlights the importance of understanding how both trailing and leading edges respond to global change and extreme events.",2024,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,30,7,,WOS:001275186100001,10.1111/gcb.17414,,#321,Nielsen 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave; physical drivers
Diverse marine heatwave intensity trends in the marginal seas of China,"Li, XM; Wu, RG; Dai, PX; Cai, RS; Tan, HJ","In the past few decades, both the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves (MHWs) have increased globally, which has been attributed to ocean surface warming. This study investigates the trend in the MHW intensity in the marginal seas of China and contributions of seasonal mean sea surface temperature (SST) trend and subseasonal (time periods less than 90 days) SST variance trend. The MHW intensity trend displays spatially non-uniform features and seasonal differences. It is found that both seasonal mean SST trend and subseasonal SST variance trend are required to account for the MHW mean intensity trend. In most of the South China Sea, subseasonal SST variance displays a decreasing trend, indicating a reduction in day-to-day SST fluctuations. This results in weak or negative trend in the MHW mean intensity though seasonal mean SST displays a prominent rising trend. In the Gulf of Tonkin in winter and the eastern Yellow Sea in summer where seasonal mean SST trend is relatively small, subseasonal SST variance trend induces an increasing trend in the MHW mean intensity. In the East China Sea in winter, seasonal mean SST increasing trend has a main contribution and the increased subseasonal SST variance has a supplementary contribution to the increase in the MHW mean intensity. Further analysis reveals that the subseasonal SST variance is regulated by the seasonal mean SST gradient.

To determine whether this ""marine heatwave"" resulted in shifts in microbial populations, we sequenced therpoC1 gene from the biogeochemically important picocyanobacteriaProchlorococcusandSynechococcusat 434 time points from 2009-2018 in the MICRO time series at Newport Beach, CA. Across the time series, we observed an increase in the abundance ofProchlorococcusrelative toSynechococcusas well as elevated frequencies of ecotypes commonly associated with low-nutrient and high-temperature conditions. The relationships between environmental and ecotype trends appeared to operate on differing temporal scales. In contrast to ecotype trends, most microdiverse populations were static and possibly reflect local habitat conditions. The only exceptions were microdiversity fromProchlorococcousHLI andSynechococcusClade II that shifted in response to the 2015 El Nino event.

Multivariate statistical analyses identified significant depth- and season-dependent trends that were accentuated during the Blob. Moreover, network and indicator analyses identified shifts in specific prokaryotic assemblages from typically particle-associated before the Blob to taxa considered free-living and chemoautotrophic during the Blob, with potential implications for primary production and organic carbon conversion and export.Traving et al. use small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to examine spatial and temporal trends in bacterial and archaeal community structure during a large marine warm water surface anomaly, the Blob.

Remote tropical central Pacific influence on driving sea surface temperature variability in the Northeast Pacific,"Hong, HJ; Hsu, HH","The Northeast Pacific (NEP) had two record-breaking marine heatwave events in the winters of 2013-2015 and summer of 2019, which had a detrimental impact on the fisheries, marine ecosystems, and climate in North America. Here, we investigated the cause of sea surface temperature (SST) variability in NEP during late spring-summer of 1981-2020. The regression circulation anomalies to the principal component of leading empirical orthogonal function mode suggested that the warm NEP SST were characterized by a cyclonic circulation anomaly in the midlatitude North Pacific and a warming SST center in the Gulf of Alaska. We noted that this cyclonic circulation anomaly, attributable to a barotropic atmospheric wave originating from the tropical central Pacific (CP) in the preceding spring, reduced the surface heat flux loss from the ocean to the atmosphere in the NEP and led to the warm SST anomalies in summer. This finding was confirmed by not only empirical diagnosis but also long-term numerical simulations forced by the observed SST perturbations in the tropical CP. Our results highlight the role of the tropical CP SST in driving the summertime North Pacific SST variability through the atmospheric bridge in recent decades.",2023,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,18,4,,WOS:000949692400001,10.1088/1748-9326/acc087,,#335,Hong 2023,"",heatwave; indicators; physical drivers
Unraveling the Indian monsoon's role in fueling the unprecedented 2022 Marine Heatwave in the Western North Pacific,"Song, QH; Wang, CZ; Yao, YL; Fan, HJ","An unprecedented marine heatwave (MHW) event occurred in the middle-high latitudes of the western North Pacific during the summer of 2022. We demonstrate that excessive precipitation thousands of kilometers away fuels this extreme MHW event in July 2022. In the upper atmosphere, a persistent atmospheric blocking system, forming over the MHW region, reduces cloud cover and increases shortwave radiation at the ocean surface, leading to high sea surface temperatures. Atmospheric perturbations induced by latent heat release from the extreme precipitation in the Indian summer monsoon region enhance this atmospheric blocking through the propagation of quasi-stationary Rossby waves. Our hypothesis is verified by using a numerical model that is forced with the observed atmospheric anomalous diabatic heating. This study sheds light on how a subtropical extreme event can fuel another extreme event at middle-high latitudes through an atmospheric teleconnection.",2024,,NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE,7,1,,WOS:001204430600001,10.1038/s41612-024-00645-x,,#339,Song 2024,"",heatwave; physical drivers

Reducing local impacts can increase reef resistance to and recovery from bleaching(2). However, resource managers lack clear advice on targeted actions that best support coral reefs under climate change(3) and sector-based governance means most land- and sea-based management efforts remain siloed(4). Here we combine surveys of reef change with a unique 20-year time series of land-sea human impacts that encompassed an unprecedented marine heatwave in Hawai'i. Reefs with increased herbivorous fish populations and reduced land-based impacts, such as wastewater pollution and urban runoff, had positive coral cover trajectories predisturbance. These reefs also experienced a modest reduction in coral mortality following severe heat stress compared to reefs with reduced fish populations and enhanced land-based impacts. Scenario modelling indicated that simultaneously reducing land-sea human impacts results in a three- to sixfold greater probability of a reef having high reef-builder cover four years postdisturbance than if either occurred in isolation.

Marine heatwaves alter the nursery function of coastal habitats for juvenile Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod,"Thalmann, HL; Laurel, BJ; Almeida, LZ; Osborne, KE; Marshall, K; Miller, JA","Marine Heatwaves (MHWs) can directly influence survival of marine fishes, particularly for early life stages, including age-0 juveniles during their residence in coastal nursery habitats. However, the ability of nurseries to support high fish densities, optimize foraging and growth, and protect against predators may be altered during MHWs. Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) larval, juvenile, and adult abundances declined dramatically following MHW events in 2014-2016 and 2019. To evaluate coastal nursery function during MHWs, we compared diet composition, recent growth, size, condition, and abundance of age-0 juveniles throughout their first summer before, during, and between MHWs. Diet shifted to larger prey during MHWs, particularly mysids, but diet did not appear to influence growth. We observed faster growth rates during MHWs, yet even when accounting for growth, we could not explain the higher body sizes observed in August during MHWs. Together with lower abundance and the near absence of small fish in the nursery by August during MHWs, these patterns highlight potential for size-selection and a reduced ability of nursery habitats to buffer against environmental variability during MHWs, with only a small number of large ""super survivors"" persisting through the summer.",2024,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,14,1,,WOS:001258394400040,10.1038/s41598-024-63897-w,,#342,Thalmann 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
"Morlet Cross-Wavelet Analysis of Climatic State Variables Expressed as a Function of Latitude, Longitude, and Time: New Light on Extreme Events","Pinault, JL","This study aims to advance our knowledge in the genesis of extreme climatic events with the dual aim of improving forecasting methods while clarifying the role played by anthropogenic warming. Wavelet analysis is used to highlight the role of coherent Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies produced from short-period oceanic Rossby waves resonantly forced, with two case studies: a Marine Heatwave (MHW) that occurred in the northwestern Pacific with a strong climatic impact in Japan, and an extreme flood event that occurred in Germany. Ocean-atmosphere interactions are evidenced by decomposing state variables into period bands within the cross-wavelet power spectra, namely SST, Sea Surface Height (SSH), and the zonal and meridional modulated geostrophic currents as well as precipitation height, i.e., the thickness of the layer of water produced during a day, with regard to subtropical cyclones. The bands are chosen according to the different harmonic modes of the oceanic Rossby waves. In each period band, the joint analysis of the amplitude and the phase of the state variables allow the estimation of the regionalized intensity of anomalies versus their time lag in relation to the date of occurrence of the extreme event. Regarding MHWs in the northwestern Pacific, it is shown how a warm SST anomaly associated with the northward component of the wind resulting from the low-pression system induces an SST response to latent and sensible heat transfer where the latitudinal SST gradient is steep. The SST anomaly is then shifted to the north as the phase becomes homogenized. As for subtropical cyclones, extreme events are the culmination of exceptional circumstances, some of which are foreseeable due to their relatively long maturation time. This is particularly the case of ocean-atmosphere interactions leading to the homogenization of the phase of SST anomalies that can potentially contribute to the supply of low-pressure systems. The same goes for the coalescence of distinct low-pressure systems during cyclogenesis. Some avenues are developed with the aim of better understanding how anthropogenic warming can modify certain key mechanisms in the evolution of those dynamic systems leading to extreme events.",2022,,MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL APPLICATIONS,27,3,,WOS:000815983900001,10.3390/mca27030050,,#345,Pinault 2022,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Diversity of Marine Heatwaves in the South China Sea Regulated by ENSO Phase,"Liu, K; Xu, K; Zhu, CW; Liu, BQ","Marine heatwaves (MHWs) in the South China Sea (SCS) have dramatic impacts on local ecosystems, fisheries, and aquacultures. Our results show that SCS MHWs were strongly regulated by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) with a distinct life cycle during 1982-2018. Based on the ENSO-associated sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) warming peaks in the SCS, we can classify SCS MHWs into three categories: El Nino-P1 during the first warming peak of El Nino from September to the following February, El Nino-P2 during the second warming peak of El Nino from the following June to September, and La Nina-P1 during the single warming peak of La Nina from the following February to May. The three types of SCS MHWs are all affected by the lower-level enhanced anticyclone over the western North Pacific (WNP), but their physical mechanisms are quite different. In El Nino-P1, SCS MHWs are mostly induced by enhanced net downward shortwave radiation and reduced latent heat flux loss over the southwestern and northern SCS, respectively. In El Nino-P2, SCS MHWs are primarily attributed to weaker entrainment cooling caused by a local enhanced anticyclone and stronger Ekman downwelling in the central-northern SCS. However, in La Nina-P1, SCS MHWs are mainly contributed by the reduced latent heat loss due to the weaker WNP anticyclone centered east of the Philippines on the pentad time scale. The distinct spatial distributions of MHWs show phase locking with ENSO-associated SCS SSTA warming, which provides a potential seasonal forecast of SCS MHWs according to the ENSO phase.",2022,,JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,35,2,877-893,WOS:000799188000023,10.1175/JCLI-D-21-0309.1,,#347,Liu 2022,"",heatwave; physical drivers
"Age, not growth, explains larger body size of Pacific cod larvae during recent marine heatwaves","Miller, JA; Almeida, LZ; Rogers, LA; Thalmann, HL; Forney, RM; Laurel, BJ","Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are often associated with physiological changes throughout biological communities but can also result in biomass declines that correspond with shifts in phenology. We examined the response of larval Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) to MHWs in the Gulf of Alaska across seven years to evaluate the effects of MHWs on hatch phenology, size-at-age, and daily growth and identify potential regulatory mechanisms. Hatch dates were, on average, 19 days earlier since the onset of MHWs, shifting a mean of 15 days earlier per 1 degree celsius increase. Size-at-capture was larger during & between MHWs but, contrary to expectations, larvae grew slower and were smaller in size-at-age. The larger size during & between MHWs can be entirely explained by older ages due to earlier hatching. Daily growth variation was well-explained by an interaction among age, temperature, and hatch date. Under cool conditions, early growth was fastest for the latest hatchers. However, this variation converged at warmer temperatures, due to faster growth of earlier hatchers. Stage-specific growth did not vary with temperature, remaining relatively similar from 4 to 8 degree celsius. Temperature-related demographic changes were more predictable based on phenological shifts rather than changes in growth, which could affect population productivity after MHWs.",2024,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,14,1,,WOS:001295308500008,10.1038/s41598-024-69915-1,,#349,Miller 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Temperature variations in the northern Gulf of Alaska across synoptic to century-long time scales,"Danielson, SL; Hennon, TD; Monson, DH; Suryan, RM; Campbell, RW; Baird, SJ; Holderied, K; Weingartner, TJ","Surface and subsurface moored buoy, ship-based, remotely sensed, and reanalysis datasets are used to investigate thermal variability of northern Gulf of Alaska (NGA) nearshore, coastal, and offshore waters over synoptic to century-long time scales. NGA sea surface temperature (SST) showed a larger positive trend of 0.22 +/- 0.10 ?C per decade over 1970-2021 compared to 0.10 +/- 0.03 ?C per decade over 1900-2021. Over synoptic time scales, SST covariance between two stations is small (< 10%) when separation exceeds 100 km, while stations separated by 500 km retain 50% of their co-variability for seasonal and longer fluctuations. Relative to in situ sensor data, remotely sensed SST data has limited accuracy in some NGA settings, capturing 60-70% of the daily SST anomaly in coastal and offshore waters, but often < 25% nearshore. North Pacific and NGA leading modes of SST vari-ability leave 25-50% of monthly variance unresolved. Analysis of the 2014-2016 Pacific marine heatwave shows that NGA coastal surface temperatures warmed contemporaneously with offshore waters through 2013, but deep inner shelf waters (200-250 m) exhibited delayed warming. Offshore surface waters cooled from 2014 to 2016, while shelf waters continued to warm from the combined effects of local air-sea and advective heat fluxes. We find that annually averaged Sitka air temperature is a leading predictor (r(2) = 0.37, p < 0.05) for following-year NGA coastal water column temperature.

Echoes of the 2013-2015 Marine Heat Wave in the Eastern Bering Sea and Consequent Biological Responses,"Belkin, IM; Short, JW","We reviewed various physical and biological manifestations of an unprecedented large-scale water temperature anomaly that emerged in the Northeast Pacific in late 2013. The anomaly dubbed ""The Blob"" persisted through 2014-2016, with some signs of its persistence through 2017-2018 and a possible reemergence in 2019. The tentative timeline of The Blob's successive appearances around the Northeast Pacific is suggestive of its advection by currents around the Gulf of Alaska, along the Aleutians, into the Bering Sea, and eventually to the Bering Strait. During the initial phase of The Blob's development in 2013-2014, advection along the Polar Front might have played a certain role. The extreme persistence and magnitude of The Blob resulted in numerous and sometimes dramatic ecosystem responses in the eastern Bering Sea. The multi-year duration of The Blob might have preconditioned the Bering Sea for the record low seasonal sea ice extent during the winter of 2017-2018 and the disappearance of the cold pool in 2016 and 2018 that profoundly affected zooplankton, invertebrates, fishes, seabirds, and marine mammals. A comparison of the time series of population responses across trophic levels suggests that The Blob lowered primary production during spring, increased production of small copepods and jellyfish, and reduced the efficiency of energy transfer to higher trophic levels. While the Bering Sea's water temperature, seasonal sea ice, and cold pool seem to return to the long-term mean state in 2022, it remains to be seen if the Bering Sea ecosystem will completely recover.

We examined the effects of local oceanic conditions (sea surface temperature, surface chlorophyll, sea surface height, eddy kinetic energy), as well as large-scale oceanographic phenomena, such as El Nino, on PBF availability to commercial and recreational fishing fleets. Results from generalized additive models showed that warmer temperatures of around 17-21 degrees C with low surface chlorophyll concentrations (<0.5 mg/m(3)) increased probability of occurrence of PBF in the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel and purse seine fisheries. These associations were particularly evident during a recent marine heatwave (the ""Blob""). In contrast, PBF were most likely to be encountered on drift gillnet gear in somewhat cooler waters (13-18 degrees C), with moderate chlorophyll concentrations (0.5-1.0 mg/m(3)). This discrepancy was likely a result of differing spatiotemporal distribution of fishing effort among fleets, as well as the different vertical depths fished by each gear, demonstrating the importance of understanding selectivity when building correlative habitat models. In the future, monitoring and understanding environmentally driven changes in the availability of PBF to commercial and recreational fisheries can contribute to the implementation of ecosystem approaches to fishery management.",2019,,FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY,28,4,372-388,WOS:000471812800002,10.1111/fog.12418,,#354,Runcie 2019,"",ecosystem response; heatwave

As such, fisheries managers are exploring new recruitment paradigms for Pacific cod under novel environmental conditions. In this review, we address the challenges of managing and forecasting Pacific cod populations in the Eastern Pacific where thermal habitats for early life stages are undergoing varying rates of change across space and time. We use observational data to examine changes in distribution, abundance and demographics of the population from 1993 to 2020, and model contemporary and future changes of thermal habitat for both spawning success and age-0 juvenile growth potential. Results indicate that reduced spawning habitat and early life stage abundance may be a precursor to regional population decline, but the recent apparent increases in size-at-age of pre-recruits will have unknown impacts on future recruitment in these regions. We contend that continued monitoring of early life stages will be necessary to track changes in phenology and growth that likely determine size-at-age and the survival trajectories of year classes into the adult population. These include complex size- and temperature-dependent energetics spanning seasonal habitats through the first winter.

Spatial and Temporal Characteristics and Mechanisms of Marine Heatwaves in the Changjiang River Estuary and Its Surrounding Coastal Regions,"Xie, MH; Ji, QY; Zheng, QD; Meng, ZY; Wang, YT; Gao, ML","Marine heatwave (MHW) events have significant consequences for marine ecosystems and human society. This paper investigates a MHW's spatial-temporal characteristics in the Changjiang River Estuary and its surrounding coastal regions (CRESs), as well as analyzes the drivers, using satellite and reanalysis data spanning from 1982-2021. The findings show that, during the last 40 years, all four of the MHW indicators have increased. The summer MHW is more severe than other seasons, showing a rising pattern from southeast to northwest. The rise of MHWs can be attributed to the increase in sea surface heat flux, weak wind speed, and powerful El Ni & ntilde;o events.

"Reduced barnacle larval abundance and settlement in response to large-scale oceanic disturbances: Temporal patterns, nearshore thermal stratification, and potential mechanisms","Pineda, J; Reyns, N; Lentz, SJ","We assessed the effects of large-scale oceanic disturbances on the settlement rate of an abundant intertidal barnacle. Daily or weekly settlement, nearshore temperature, currents, and abundance of early-stage barnacle nauplii and Chthamalus fissus cyprids were measured in La Jolla, California, from the inception of the large-scale warm-water anomaly known as the ""Blob"" in 2014, to 1 yr following the 2015/2016 El Nino. We also measured over 2 yr of weekly settlement rates during the 1997/1998 El Nino in La Jolla and in two Mexican sites. Settlement was low during the Blob and the 2015/2016 El Nino, but increased dramatically after its end, and rates remained high through spring 2017. Barnacle nauplii and C. fissus cyprid abundances were also low during the Blob and El Nino. Nearshore water column thermal stratification and variability of the high-frequency cross-shore currents, a measure of internal wave activity, declined during the Blob and El Nino, but increased at the end of El Nino. Similarly, settlement rates in the Mexican sites were low during the 1997/1998 El Nino. The reduction in settlement during the Blob and El Nino may be related to two factors: a decrease in water column stratification, which can influence internal bore larval transport and the cross-shore distribution of larvae, and also to reduced early-stage larval abundance, potentially related to lower reproductive output or high nauplii mortality during the disturbances.",2018,,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,63,6,2618-2629,WOS:000450233300022,10.1002/lno.10964,,#366,Pineda 2018,"",ecosystem response; heatwave; physical drivers
An emergent treat: Marine heatwaves-Implications for marine decapod crustacean species-An overview,"Monteiro, M; de Castro, SLP; Marques, SC; Freitas, R; Azeiteiro, UM","Anthropogenic-mediated climate change severely affects the oceans. The most common definition of a Marine heatwave (MHW) considers that water temperatures rise above the 90th percentile threshold values, based on the last 30 years' average of temperature records for a particular location, and remains this high for five or more days. The current review addresses the evolution of definitions used, as well as the current understanding of the driving mechanisms of MHWs. The collected information shows that the study of MHW is recent and there is a growing interest among the scientific community on this topic, motivated largely by the impacts that pose to marine ecosystems. Further, a more in-depth analysis was carried out, addressing the impacts of MHW events on marine decapod crustacean species. The investigation of such impacts has been carried out using three main methodological approaches: the analysis of in situ records, observed in 33 studies; simulating MHW events through mesocosm experiments, found in 6 studies; and using computational predictive models, detected in 1 study. From the literature available it has been demonstrated that consequences are serious for these species, from altered expansion ranges to alterations of assemblages' abundances. Still, studies addressing the impacts of these extreme events on the decapod communities are scarce, often only limited to adult life forms of commercially relevant species, neglecting non-commercial ones and meroplanktonic life stages. Despite the severe impacts on the health of ecosystems, repercussions on socioeconomic human activities, like fisheries and aquaculture, are also a reality. Overall, this review aims to raise scientific and public awareness of these marine events, which are projected to increase in intensity and frequency in the coming decades.

As upper trophic species, marine birds reflect shifts in trophic structure and stability; therefore, a sharp increase in marine bird mortality is a clear signal of ecosystem impact. In this study, we analyzed 29 yr (1993-2021) of beached bird monitoring data (similar to 90000 surveys) to identify marine bird mortality events throughout the Northeast Pacific and Alaska, USA, and examined linkages to ocean-climate variability. Mortality events were documented throughout the study period, but massive events (>500 km in extent, >10 carcasses km(-1)) occurred infrequently (n = 5), with an unprecedented sequence from 2014-2019. Event characteristics, including encounter rate (carcasses km(-1)), duration, and spatial extent, were positively related to prior-year averaged sea surface temperature anomaly, with event magnitude (product of encounter rate, extent, and duration) displaying a step-like transition, increasing 5-fold between +0 degrees C and +1 degrees C above baseline (1981-2010) temperatures.

We analyzed a unique dataset collected in shallow waters along central California spanning more than four decades (1978-2020) and assessed links with basin-scale climate modes [Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Nino (MEI)] and regional-scale wind-driven upwelling. We found no significant increase/decrease in MHW/MCS frequency, duration, or intensity over the last four decades, but did observe considerable interannual variability linked with basin-scale climate modes. Additionally, there was a decrease in both MHW/MCS occurrence during the upwelling season, and the initiation of individual MHWs/MCSs coincided with anomalous upwelling. Most notably, the co-occurrence of warm (cold) phases of the PDO and MEI with negative (positive) upwelling anomalies strongly enhanced the relative frequency of positive (negative) temperature anomalies and MHW (MCS) days.

The 2022 summer marine heatwaves and coral bleaching in China's Greater Bay Area,"Zhao, Y; Chen, MR; Chung, TH; Chan, LL; Qiu, JW","From July to August 2022, scleractinian coral communities in China's Greater Bay Area (GBA) in the northern South China Sea (nSCS) experienced an unprecedented bleaching event, despite the fact that coral communities in this area are often considered coral thermal refugia due to their high latitude distribution. Field surveys of six sites covering three main coral distribution areas of the GBA revealed that coral bleaching occurred at all sites. Bleaching was more severe in shallow water (1-3 m) than in deep water (4-6 m), as indicated by both percent bleached cover (51.80 & PLUSMN; 10.04% vs. 7.09 & PLUSMN; 7.37%) and bleached colonies (45.86 & PLUSMN; 11.22% vs. 6.58 & PLUSMN; 6.53%). Coral genera Acropora, Favites, Montipora, Platygyra, Pocillopora, and Porites showed high susceptibility to bleaching, and Acropora and Pocillopora suffered high post-bleaching mortality. In the three areas surveyed, analysis of oceanographic data detected marine heatwaves (MHWs) during the summer, with mean intensities between 1.62 and 1.97 degrees C and durations between 5 and 22 days. These MHWs were primarily driven by increased shortwave radiation due to strong western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), combined with reduced mixing between the surface and deep upwelling waters due to reduced wind speed. Comparing with histological oceanographic data showed that the 2022 MHWs were unprecedented, and there was a significant increase in the frequency, intensity, and total days of MHWs during 1982-2022. Furthermore, the heterogeneous distribution of summer MHW characteristics indicates that the coastal upwelling may modulate the spatial distribution of summer MHWs in nSCS through its cooling effect. Overall, our study indicates that MHWs may have affected the structure of the subtropical coral communities in the nSCS, and impaired their potential as thermal refugia.",2023,,MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,189,,,WOS:001034576500001,10.1016/j.marenvres.2023.106044,,#373,Zhao 2023,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Differential response of seabird species to warm- and cold-water events in a heterogeneous cross-shelf environment in the Gulf of Alaska,"Cushing, DA; Kuletz, KJ; Sousa, L; Day, RH; Danielson, SL; Labunski, EA; Hopcroft, RR","We used seabird surveys and concurrent oceanographic observations in the Northern Gulf of Alaska during spring 1998-2019 to evaluate how seabirds responded to temperature variability, including a protracted marine heatwave, in a highly heterogeneous ecosystem. We examined temporally changing distributions of seabirds along the Seward Line, a 220 km transect across the shelf and slope, and evaluated relationships between water-mass properties and seabird abundance. Environmental factors associated with abundance include depth, water-column temperature and salinity, and surface-current velocities. Environmental responses of alcids and gulls contrasted with those of procellariiform (tubenose) seabirds, and their trajectories suggest a possible shift in community composition under future climate warming. Changes in seabird distribution and abundance associated with a shift from cold to warm conditions were especially pronounced over the middle- and outer-shelf domains, which are transitional between coastal and oceanic water masses. The abundance of tubenoses increased during and after the heatwave, whereas alcids and gulls shifted inshore, exhibited reproductive failures, and experienced mass mortalities due to starvation. Tubenoses appear well-adapted to periods of lower productivity during warming events because of their flight efficiency, allowing them to search widely to locate prey patches. In contrast, alcids, which forage by diving and have energetically expensive flight, appear sensitive to such conditions.",2024,,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,737,,31-58,WOS:001249746900010,10.3354/meps14239,,#376,Cushing 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Understanding the impact of environmental variability and fisheries on the red sea urchin population in Baja California,"Medellín-Ortiz, A; Montaño-Moctezuma, G; Alvarez-Flores, C; Santamaría-del-Angel, E; García-Nava, H; Beas-Luna, R; Cavanaugh, K","IntroductionThe red sea urchin fishery is one of the most important fisheries in Baja California and the only urchin fishery in Mexico; yet little is known on understanding how local, regional, and oceanic environmental variability may affect red sea urchin populations. MethodsWe analyzed how food availability, predator abundance and environmental variability could affect red sea urchin populations developing generalized linear models under different temperature conditions: Pre-heat wave, heat wave, and post-heatwave, including sites where sea surface temperature was above, below, and on average. Models included: a) biological variables: Macrocystis pyrifera (kelp) biomass, red sea urchin (Mesocentrotus franciscanus) density, sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher), kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus) and spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) catches, and b) oceanographic variables: sea surface temperature, wave power, upwelling index, multivariate El Nino index and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index. ResultsBetween 65 and 82% of the variability observed in red sea urchin populations was explained by different combinations of variables, depending on the thermal condition analyzed. We observed that local environmental variability, such as food availability and predator harvest are highly important factors in determining red sea urchin population changes, compared to regional and oceanic scale variables such as upwelling, El Nino, or the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Results show that the relative importance of these variables changed depending on the spatial and temporal scale being analyzed, meaning that under ""normal or average"" conditions one set of variables is important, compared to extreme environmental conditions such as El Nino or ""the Blob"" when a different set of variables explained the observed variability. Urchin predators' catches were correlated with urchin density during the pre-heatwave scenario, suggesting that under ""average temperature"" conditions the effect of fishing on predators, and consequently on urchin density is higher than local temperature, the most important variable during warm conditions. DiscussionThis study suggests that in Baja California, red sea urchin harvest has become the most important red sea urchin population control, so efforts should be encouraged and supported by state and federal agencies to promote more resilient ecosystems in the face of environmental uncertainty.

Attribution of the unprecedented summer 2022 compound marine and terrestrial heatwave in the Northwest Pacific,"Chen, QJ; Li, DL; Feng, JL; Qi, JF; Zhao, L; Yin, BS","In boreal summer (July-August) 2022, an unprecedented marine heatwave (MHW) occurred in the northwest Pacific Ocean (NWP), while a record-breaking terrestrial heatwave (THW) hit the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). The temperature anomalies caused by this compound MHW-THW event exceeded climatology by 2.5 standard deviations (SDs), breaking the historical record for nearly 100 years, with severe impacts on the ecosystems and social economy. To investigate the underlying causes, we explored the potential roles of anthropogenic forcing, atmospheric circulation, and 'triple-dip' La Ni & ntilde;a on this compound event using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) multi-model simulations. Results indicate that the 2022-like compound MHW-THW event was extremely unlikely to happen without anthropogenic warming, and that such extreme heatwaves were governed by the climatic mean temperature rather than changes in temperature variability. Notably, the anticyclone circulation patterns and associated high-pressure systems (i.e. western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) and South Asian high (SAH)) increase the probability of a 2022-like MHW-THW event by 3.7 times. However, the La Ni & ntilde;a phase has no significant effect on the occurrence probability of such events. We further estimate that the 2022-like MHW-THW event will become 7.5 and 11.4 times more likely under the SSP3-7.0 scenario by the middle and end of the 21st century, respectively. This study demonstrates the contribution of anthropogenic climate change and natural variability to the occurrence of compound MHW-THW events and highlights the urgent need to build mitigation strategies for compound MHW-THW events.",2024,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,19,7,,WOS:001262687800001,10.1088/1748-9326/ad5ab0,,#380,Chen 2024,"",attribution study; heatwave; physical drivers

During the Pacific Marine Heatwave (PMH), intertidal barnacle cover increased in the northern Gulf of Alaska (GoA); however, the role of pelagic larval supply in this increase was unknown. Using long-term monitoring data on intertidal benthic (percent cover) and pelagic larval populations (nauplii and cyprid concentrations), we examined potential environmental drivers (temperature, chlorophyll-a, mixed layer depth) of larval concentration and whether including larval concentration at regional and annual scales improved intertidal barnacle percent cover models in two study regions in the GoA. In both regions, larval concentrations were slightly higher following the PMH. Percent cover models were improved by including cyprid concentrations (but not nauplii), and the effect strength varied by site and tidal elevation. This indicates that larval concentration contributes as a bottom-up driver of benthic barnacle abundance. There is little evidence of a direct effect of the PMH on either life stage. Instead, our results may illustrate the positive feedback between life stages, where higher adult benthic abundance increased larval concentrations, which then supplied more new recruits to the benthos.

Depth-Resolved Net Primary Production in the Northeast Pacific Ocean: A Comparison of Satellite and Profiling Float Estimates in the Context of Two Marine Heatwaves,"Long, JS; Fassbender, AJ; Estapa, ML","Methods commonly used to estimate net primary production (NPP) from satellite observations are now being applied to biogeochemical (BGC) profiling float observations. Insights can be gained from regional differences in float and satellite NPP estimates that reveal gaps in our understanding and guide future NPP model development. We use 7 years of BGC profiling float data from the Northeast Pacific Ocean to quantify discrepancies between float and satellite NPP estimates and decompose them into contributions associated with the platform sensing method and depth resolution of observations. We find small, systematic seasonal discrepancies in the depth-integrated NPP (iNPP) but much larger (>+/- 100%) discrepancies in depth-resolved NPP. Annual iNPP estimates from the two platforms are significantly, positively correlated, suggesting that they similarly track interannual variability in the study region.

Record-low coastal sea levels in the Northeast Pacific during the winter of 2013-2014,"Wang, YQ; Liu, HL; Lin, PF; Yin, JJ","During the winter of 2013-2014, the averaged tide gauge (TG) coastal sea level (CSL) anomaly north of 40 degrees N was a record low of -107 mm for the period of 1948-2016. Statistical analysis indicates that this large drop was a once-in-a-century event and closely related to an unusual ocean warming event known as ""The Blob"". The Blob developed in the NE Pacific during the winter of 2013-2014. Both the Blob and record-low CSL can be attributed to wind changes associated with an unusually high sea level pressure (SLP) pattern over the NE Pacific. The anomalous local longshore winds induced by the positive SLP anomalies caused strong offshore Ekman transport along the coast of NE Pacific, thereby leading to the record-low CSL. In addition, the steric sea level changes also contributed a significant part (17%) to the record-low CSL. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), as the primary variability mode in the NE Pacific on decadal time scales, did not contribute to the emergence of this extreme CSL event.",2019,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,9,,,WOS:000460508600004,10.1038/s41598-019-40397-w,,#385,Wang 2019,"",heatwave; physical drivers
"Warmer, earlier, faster: Cumulative effects of Gulf of Alaska heatwaves on the early life history of Pacific cod","Almeida, LZ; Laurel, BJ; Thalmann, HL; Miller, JA","Warming climates are creating unprecedented environmental conditions, such as more frequent and intense marine heatwaves (MHWs), that directly impact phenology and growth of fish and other marine organisms. Understanding individual phenological and growth responses to temperature is critical to predict species and population responses to climate change; however, doing so requires disentangling the effects of temperature on phenology, size, and growth in wild populations. We quantified the relationships between temperature and hatch timing, size-at-age, and early growth in a population of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) affected by recent MHWs in the Gulf of Alaska. Pacific cod juveniles were collected near Kodiak Island, Alaska, USA, across 11 years, categorized as before (2007, 2009-2010, 2012-2014), during (2015, 2016, 2019), and between (2017, 2018) multiple recent MHWs. We estimated age and growth with otolith structural analysis. Hatching occurred on average 14 days earlier during MHWs and 26 days earlier between than before MHWs. Approximately 53% and 16% of these respective shifts in timing were attributable directly to warmer temperatures during incubation. Size-at-age was similar across periods at younger ages (90 days), but approximately 7 mm and 11 mm larger than before MHWs at older ages (132 days) during and between MHWs, respectively. These differences in size-at-age were partially related to growth responses that differed among MHW periods. However, observed differences in growth rate could not account for the observed increases in size-at-age. We found that temperature alone could not explain the changes in growth and phenology; thus, factors such as parental effects, epigenetics, and selection likely contributed. Our results indicate that spawn timing, size, and growth relationships based on historical thermal responses should be questioned in population forecasting as the global climate continues to warm.",2024,,ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE,12,1,,WOS:001174557200001,10.1525/elementa.2023.00050,,#388,Almeida 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Lack of strong responses to the Pacific marine heatwave by benthivorous marine birds indicates importance of trophic drivers,"Robinson, B; Coletti, HA; Ballachey, B; Bodkin, JL; Kloecker, K; Traiger, SB; Esler, D","The Pacific marine heatwave (PMH) of 2014-2016 was an intense, long-lasting environmental disturbance expressed throughout the north Pacific. While dramatic consequences of the PMH on pelagic food webs have been well documented, effects on nearshore food webs, i.e. those based on macroalgal primary productivity, benthic invertebrate intermediate consumers, and specialized benthivorous top predators including some marine birds, are not well understood. We conducted summer and winter coastline marine bird surveys in 2 National Parks in the northern Gulf of Alaska from 2006 to 2022. We evaluated changes in abundance of benthivorous marine birds in relation to the PMH, after accounting for effects of season and region. We also evaluated changes in abundance of nearshore benthic invertebrate prey to allow specific consideration of a prey-based mechanism for effects of the PMH across food webs. We found that benthivorous marine birds, consisting of sea ducks and shorebirds, did not show a strong response to the PMH, unlike significant effects demonstrated by piscivorous birds in pelagic biomes. In contrast to extreme reductions in quantity and quality of forage fish documented elsewhere, we found that common benthic invertebrate prey abundance remained relatively stable. Our results support the hypothesis that, across food webs, top predator responses to the PMH were driven primarily by how and whether the PMH affected their prey availability. These findings show how a large-scale environmental perturbation affects biological communities differently through various trophic pathways, which provides insight into ecosystem resiliency and can inform management strategies in the face of persistent climate change.",2024,,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,737,,215-226,WOS:001249746900014,10.3354/meps14384,,#389,Robinson 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Importance of the choice of heat flux parameterization in regional air-sea coupled simulations: Case studies of marine heatwaves induced by atmospheric heatwaves in 1994 and 2018,"Jeong, TB; Bae, HJ; Kim, BM; Yang, SN","This study investigated the marine heat wave events (MHWs) that occurred near the Korean Peninsula during the summer of 1994 and 2018, using a regional air-sea coupled model. We analyzed the fifth-generation reanalysis data, ERA5, published by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for both events. We found that the North Pacific High and Tibetan High were stronger than usual and were associated with warm and moist air intrusion from the subtropical regions. Air-sea interactions play an important role in the development of MHWs. Warm and moist air combined with low-level inversion and a subsequent sinking motion induced the downward latent heat flux (LHF) toward the relatively colder sea surface, resulting in increased sea surface temperatures (SSTs). To quantify the contribution of the downward LHF and evaluate the importance of the relevant physical parameters of the MHWs, we set up two coupled model experiments, namely, CPL_down and CPL_nodown. Results show that the CPL_down experiment captured the downward LHF well in both events. The model also successfully captured the observed inversion near the surface. The cold SST bias tended to be reduced as the low-level clouds decreased in the area where the downward LHF occurred. In our simulation, permitting downward LHF improved the MHW reproducibility. Therefore, we suggest that the increased downward LHF is favorable for simulating MHWs, and surface physical parameterization must be carefully performed.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,9,,,WOS:000890249900001,10.3389/fmars.2022.1032930,,#390,Jeong 2022,"",heatwave; physical drivers
Reduction in overwinter body condition and size of Pacific sand lance has implications for piscivorous predators during marine heatwaves,"Robinson, CLK; Bertram, DF; Shannon, H; von Biela, VR; Greentree, W; Duguid, W; Arimitsu, ML","Acute anomalous ocean warming events, including marine heatwaves (MHWs), have significant effects on reproduction and survival of piscivorous seabirds. Additionally, MHWs have negative effects on seabird fish prey, exacerbating these consequences and resulting in population implications for seabirds. We evaluated the relative body condition of Pacific sand lance Ammodytes personatus, an important seabird forage species, in Haro Strait, a highly productive region of southern British Columbia, Canada. We compared body condition and length of fish cohorts that experienced the 2016 MHW year (MHW cohorts) with fish hatched during 3 subsequent post MHW years (2017-2019). Age-0 MHW cohorts had a seasonal decline in body condition in age-0 fish from 100% in the summer to 81% in the winter, while age-1 fish showed a decline from summer-fall highs of 93.5% to wintertime low of 79.5%. In comparison, post MHW cohorts had a winter body condition that was 2-4 times higher than their MHW cohorts. Similar to previous studies in Alaska during the MHW, age-1 fish failed to grow and reach the typical size that distinguishes them from age-0 fish. Poor sand lance condition and growth in winter may explain the ramifications of a warming ocean for top predators, including seabirds and Pacific salmon, which depend on these prey fish in Haro Strait. Our results support the idea that Haro Strait, which is influenced by estuarine circulation resulting in cooler temperatures than surrounding areas, serves as a climate refugium for sand lance populations in summer and provides buffering capacity to ocean climate warming events.",2024,,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,737,,89-99,WOS:001249746900011,10.3354/meps14257,,#395,Robinson 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave

Studies of this type usually assess the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed impacts. Other scientific communities have developed tools to assess how human activities influence impacts of extreme weather events on ecosystems and societies. For example, the disaster risk reduction (DRR) community analyses how the structure of human societies affects exposure, vulnerability, and ultimately the impacts of extreme weather events, with less attention to the role of anthropogenic climate change. In this perspective, we argue that adapting current practice in EEA to also consider other causal factors in attribution of extreme weather impacts would provide richer and more comprehensive insight into the causes of disasters. To this end, we propose a framework for EEA that would generate a more complete picture of human influences on impacts and bridge the gap between the EEA and DRR communities.

Perturbations in a pelagic food web during the NE pacific large marine heatwave and persistent harmful diatom blooms,"Ruiz-Cooley, RI; Anderson, C; Kudela, R; Dunkin, R; Field, J","Unprecedented warm ocean conditions, driven by the Large Marine Heatwave (LMH) and the 2015-16 El Nino in the Northeast Pacific favored pervasive toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. blooms that caused widespread ecological impacts, but little is known about the magnitude to which marine food webs were altered. Here, we assessed the trophic transfer of domoic acid (DA; a neurotoxin) and changes in trophic position from multiple key species during the peak of the LMH and El Nino in 2015 in comparison with 2018, a reference non-anomalous warm year. DA and amino acid nitrogen isotopes (delta 15N AAs) were quantified using liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, respectively. Our integrative approach revealed extremely high levels of DA in anchovy viscera (>3000 mu g/g) with contrasting baseline values (delta 15N Phe) for southern California fish. These results together with data from northern CA revealed an unforeseen latitudinal isotopic variation in key DA vectors along California, possibly driven by anomalous restructuring of water masses. At the regional level, the observed cross-shore differences in baseline isotope values and DA toxicity suggest distinct pathways for DA trophic transfer for nearshore vs. offshore sites. Given the high levels of environmental disturbance during the LMH and persistence of toxigenic P. australis blooms, our resultant higher trophic position proxies in 2015 compared to 2018 were particularly unexpected. Such results highlight complex trophic interactions, where the trophic status of some species increased while others decreased in response to changes in net primary productivity, and biodiversity, and abundance of forage species. Our study demonstrates the use of delta 15N AAs to identify pathways of N and DA trophic transfer and to quantify shifts in animal trophic position, a critical facet of understanding the response of food webs to climate change and DA production.",2024,,HARMFUL ALGAE,140,,,WOS:001364609200001,10.1016/j.hal.2024.102743,,#398,Ruiz-Cooley 2024,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Low-frequency isopycnal variability in the Alaska Gyre from Argo,"Cummins, PF; Masson, D","The deployment of a large number of Argo floats in the northeast Pacific Ocean since 2001 has led to a great increase in the volume of data available to study the regional variability on interannual to decadal time scales. In this paper, gridded fields of hydrographic data from Argo are used to examine the low-frequency variability of representative isopycnal surfaces over the Alaska Gyre in the eastern subpolar North Pacific. Anomalies in the depth of isopycnal surfaces and spice anomalies on these surfaces are considered over the 14 year period, 2004-2017.An EOF analysis is used to characterize the variability occurring at large scales over the region. The leading mode of isopycnal depth anomalies through the upper 1000 m of the water column is found to be related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The response of a stochastic climate model driven by local Elanan pumping is shown to give a reasonable account of variability in the depth of the shallow main pycnocline over the Alaska Gyre, although ocean dynamics must play a role in shaping the spatial response to the wind forcing.Evidence is presented for counter-propagating isopycnal depth anomalies in the Subarctic Current. At the depth of the main pycnocline, propagation is dominated by disturbances that are advected eastward by the mean flow. At greater depths, isopycnal depth anomalies propagate westward at approximately twice the speed of first mode, long baroclinic Rossby waves, consistent with the propagation of Rossby waves seen in altimetric observations of sea surface height variability.The eastward advection of spice anomalies is also evident in the upper ocean. However, the dominant signal in the record is a large-scale positive spice anomaly that forms locally on subsurface isopycnals. Evidence is presented that this anomaly arises mainly from the downward diffusion across the pycnocline of heat associated with the marine heatwave of 2013-14 over the northeast Pacific. The extent to which anomalies are generated locally may limit the potential for decadal prediction of upper ocean conditions over the region.",2018,,PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY,168,,310-324,WOS:000452943300023,10.1016/j.pocean.2018.09.014,,#400,Cummins 2018,Helen Killeen (2025-06-07 02:27:40)(Screen): physical impact?; ,heatwave; physical impact

Ocean conditions determine the energy stores of fish at the freshwater entry, while freshwater conditions determine how quickly stored energy is depleted as individuals migrate to spawning grounds in natal rivers and lakes. We assessed the occurrence of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) egg retention (failure to deposit eggs) in a high-latitude (similar to 65 degrees N) watershed that has a large, inter-annual variation in the number of returning adults. We also explored relationships between ocean and freshwater conditions with egg retention of female sockeye salmon. The proportion of females with egg retention (> 50 eggs) varied by threefold (12 to 36%) across years (2013 to 2020) and was related to ocean conditions represented by the North Pacific Index (NPI). Egg retention was more common in years with low NPI values (a stronger Aleutian Low) in association with the Pacific marine heatwave of 2014-2016 that disrupted food webs. This initial study contains the first empirical data observing the influence of ocean conditions on egg retention for any Pacific salmon population. The lack of any relationship between egg retention and freshwater temperatures was consistent with water temperatures primarily occurring below thresholds associated with heat stress related mortality (< 18 degrees C).

Effects of climate-change-driven gradual and acute temperature changes on shark and ray species,"Osgood, GJ; White, ER; Baum, JK","Climate change is altering distributions and abundances of marine species through both gradual and acute changes in temperature and productivity.

We compared effect sizes for SST and the Oceanic Nino Index across the different species, which vary widely in body size and mobility. Large, mobile species responded strongly but inconsistently to temperature. For scalloped hammerhead sharks Sphyrna lewini, a 1celcius rise in SST reduced counts by over 14%, and dropped the occurrence of their large schools by almost one-fifth (19.4%). Mobula ray occurrence also declined substantially with a few degrees rise in SST, whereas tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier occurrence sharply increased. These species also had divergent responses to the ENSO: S. lewini and G. cuvier were sighted with greater frequency during La Nina events, and their abundance dropped considerably during El Nino events-over a twofold decline between a strong La Nina and strong El Nino for S. lewini. In contrast, Mobula rays showed little response to ENSO. The smaller and sedentary Triaenodon obesus exhibited the weakest response of all species to both SST and the ENSO, reflecting its lower metabolic rates and mobility. Climate change will continue to impact elasmobranchs, even for smaller and more localized species, with the potential to impact the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs).

Age-specific reproduction in female Steller sea lions in Southeast Alaska,"Hastings, KK; Jemison, LA; Pendleton, GW; Johnson, DS; Gelatt, TS","Age-, region-, and year-specific estimates of reproduction are needed for monitoring wildlife populations during periods of ecosystem change. Population dynamics of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in Southeast Alaska varied regionally (with high population growth and survival in the north vs. the south) and annually (with reduced adult female survival observed following a severe marine heatwave event), but reproductive performance is currently unknown. We used mark-resighting data from 1006 Steller sea lion females marked as pups at similar to 3 weeks of age from 1994 to 1995 and from 2001 to 2005 and resighted from 2002 to 2019 (to a maximum age of 25) to examine age-, region-, and year-specific reproduction. In the north versus the south, age of first reproduction was earlier (beginning at age 4 vs. age 5, respectively) but annual birth probabilities of parous females were reduced by 0.05. In an average year pre-heatwave, the proportion of females with pup at the end of the pupping season peaked at ages 12-13 with similar to 0.60/0.65 (north/south) with pup, similar to 0.30/0.25 with juvenile, and similar to 0.10 (both regions) without a dependent. In both regions, reproductive senescence was gradual after age 12: similar to 0.40, 0.40, and 0.20 of females were in these reproductive states, respectively, by age 20. Correcting for neonatal mortality, true birth probabilities at peak ages were 0.66/0.72 (north/south). No cost of reproduction on female survival was detected, but pup production remained lower (-0.06) after the heatwave event, which if sustained could result in population decline in the south. Reduced pup production and greater retention of juveniles during periods of poor prey conditions may be an important strategy for Steller sea lions in Southeast Alaska, where fine-tuning reproduction based on nutritional status may improve the lifetime probability of producing pups under good conditions in a variable and less productive environment.",2023,,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,13,9,,WOS:001074493300001,10.1002/ece3.10515,,#419,Hastings 2023,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Phytoplankton responses to the 2014-2016 warming anomaly in the northeast subarctic Pacific Ocean,"Peña, MA; Nemcek, N; Robert, M","Significant changes in the abundance and composition of phytoplankton were observed along Line P in the northeast subarctic Pacific as a result of a rapid warming of surface waters in 2014-2015. This feature, labeled ""the blob,"" reached similar to 4 degrees C above normal and restricted winter ocean-surface nutrient renewal due to increased stratification. As a result, surface nutrients were the lowest observed and nitrate depletion in summer extended farther offshore than in the last three decades. Within this nitrate-depleted region, there was unusually low phytoplankton biomass and a dramatic increase in the dominance of cyanobacteria, including Prochlorococcus, which had not been previously observed in this region. Farther offshore, in the iron-limited region, phytoplankton biomass and the abundance of haptophytes and chlorophytes increased during ""the blob."" By 2016, surface nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations were still low, but at most of the stations, phytoplankton composition was similar to that observed before the warming occurred, except for an increase in diatoms farther offshore.

Putting the Pacific marine heatwave into perspective: The response of larval fish off southern California to unprecedented warming in 2014-2016 relative to the previous 65 years,"Thompson, AR; Ben-Aderet, NJ; Bowlin, NM; Kacev, D; Swalethorp, R; Watson, W","The 2014-2016 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave (MHW) induced the warmest 3-year period on record in the California Current Ecosystem. We tested whether larval fish assemblage structure, phenology, and diversity dynamics were comparable to past warming events from 1951 to 2013. First, we hypothesized, based on past observations of biological effect of warming, that mesopelagic species with southern distributions relative to southern California and Pacific sardine Sardinops sagax (a coastal pelagic species) would increase during the MHW while northern mesopelagics and northern anchovy Engraulis mordax (coastal pelagic) abundances would decline. Similar to past warming, southern mesopelagics increased and northern mesopelagics decreased. Unexpectedly, however, a common southern mesopelagic, Mexican lampfish Triphoturus mexicanus, was approximately three times more abundant than the previous annual high. Furthermore, whereas sardine abundance did not increase, larval anchovy abundance rose to near-record highs in summer 2016. Second, we hypothesized that fishes would spawn earlier during the MHW. Fishes did not spawn in an earlier season within a year, but five of six southern mesopelagic taxa spawned earlier than typical within winter and spring. Third, we predicted that species richness would increase moderately due to an influx of southern and exodus of northern species. Richness, however, was very high in all seasons and the highest ever during the summer as multiple species with primarily southern distributions were recorded spawning for the first time in southern California. The richness of northern species was also unexpectedly high during the MHW. Northern species likely persisted in the study area because in addition to the warm water, pockets of cold water were consistently present. If, as predicted, conditions similar to the MHW become more common as oceans warm, this unique and largely unexpected combination of fishes may reflect future biological conditions.",2022,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,28,5,1766-1785,WOS:000734112800001,10.1111/gcb.16010,,#430,Thompson 2022,"",ecosystem response; heatwave

We link this collapse to a marine heatwave in the eastern Bering Sea during 2018 and 2019.

"More Than Marine Heatwaves: A New Regime of Heat, Acidity, and Low Oxygen Compound Extreme Events in the Gulf of Alaska","Hauri, C; Pagès, R; Hedstrom, K; Doney, SC; Dupont, S; Ferriss, B; Stuecker, MF","Recent marine heatwaves in the Gulf of Alaska have had devastating impacts on species from various trophic levels. Due to climate change, total heat exposure in the upper ocean has become longer, more intense, more frequent, and more likely to happen at the same time as other environmental extremes. The combination of multiple environmental extremes can exacerbate the response of sensitive marine organisms. Our hindcast simulation provides the first indication that more than 20% of the bottom water of the Gulf of Alaska continental shelf was exposed to quadruple heat, positive hydrogen ion concentration [H+], negative aragonite saturation state (omega arag), and negative oxygen concentration [O2] compound extreme events during the 2018-2020 marine heat wave. Natural intrusion of deep and acidified water combined with the marine heat wave triggered the first occurrence of these events in 2019. During the 2013-2016 marine heat wave, surface waters were already exposed to widespread marine heat and positive [H+] compound extreme events due to the temperature effect on the [H+]. We introduce a new Gulf of Alaska Downwelling Index (GOADI) with short-term predictive skill, which can serve as indicator of past and near-future positive [H+], negative omega arag, and negative [O2] compound extreme events near the shelf seafloor. Our results suggest that the marine heat waves may have not been the sole environmental stressor that led to the observed ecosystem impacts and warrant a closer look at existing in situ inorganic carbon and other environmental data in combination with biological observations and model output.The Gulf of Alaska supports a rich ocean ecosystem and valuable fisheries. Climate change and ocean acidification threaten to disrupt marine life in the region from plankton to fish, marine mammals, and sea birds. The gradual build-up of these environmental pressures can be exacerbated further by short-term extreme events, such as marine heat waves, that can temporarily push ocean conditions beyond physiological and ecological thresholds for some organisms. The problem is worsened by the co-occurrence of extreme events for multiple factors, for example, heat and acidity. Our analysis using a regional ocean model indicates that such compound extreme events have become more frequent and intense with time in the Gulf of Alaska, raising concerns for vulnerable parts of the ecosystem. Improvements in model forecasts and observing systems may help by providing advanced warning of compound extreme events and be useful to fisheries and marine resource managers as they develop climate adaptation strategies.20% of the shelf bottom water was exposed to quadruple heat, positive [H+], negative omega arag, and negative [O2] compound extreme events in 2019Interaction of marine heat waves and local natural variability of deep-water intrusion triggered quadruple compound extreme events on shelfNew Gulf of Alaska Downwelling Index presented as indicator for environmental conditions on continental shelf",2024,,AGU ADVANCES,5,1,,WOS:001140888200001,10.1029/2023AV001039,,#439,Hauri 2024,"",acidity; compound event; deoxygenation; heatwave; indicators; physical drivers
Flexible use of a dynamic energy landscape buffers a marine predator against extreme climate variability,"Carroll, G; Brodie, S; Whitlock, R; Ganong, J; Bograd, SJ; Hazen, E; Block, BA","Animal migrations track predictable seasonal patterns of resource availability and suitable thermal habitat. As climate change alters this 'energy landscape', some migratory species may struggle to adapt. We examined how climate variability influences movements, thermal habitat selection and energy intake by juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) during seasonal foraging migrations in the California Current. We tracked 242 tuna across 15 years (2002-2016) with high-resolution archival tags, estimating their daily energy intake via abdominal warming associated with digestion (the 'heat increment of feeding'). The poleward extent of foraging migrations was flexible in response to climate variability, allowing tuna to track poleward displacements of thermal habitat where their standard metabolic rates were minimized. During a marine heatwave that saw temperature anomalies of up to +2.5 degrees C in the California Current, spatially explicit energy intake by tuna was approximately 15% lower than average. However, by shifting their mean seasonal migration approximately 900 km poleward, tuna remained in waters within their optimal temperature range and increased their energy intake. Our findings illustrate how tradeoffs between physiology and prey availability structure migration in a highly mobile vertebrate, and suggest that flexible migration strategies can buffer animals against energetic costs associated with climate variability and change.",2021,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,288,1956,,WOS:000684604700005,10.1098/rspb.2021.0671,,#442,Carroll 2021,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Inequality in the Economic Impacts from Climate Shocks in Fisheries: The Case of Harmful Algal Blooms,"Jardine, SL; Fisher, MC; Moore, SK; Samhouri, JF","Climate impacts disproportionately affect people that are most vulnerable and least able to adapt. The extent to which these equity impacts extend to fishing communities in the developed world is a question that has received surprisingly little attention. Here we explore the distributional impacts of a climate shock in one of the largest and most valuable fisheries on the West Coast of the United States. Specifically, we examine whether a series of two harmful algal blooms (HABs), occurring during the 2014-2016 Northeast Pacific Marine Heatwave, differentially affected small and large vessels in the commercial California Dungeness crab fishery. The HAB events were managed with localized fishery closures in response to elevated levels of the HAB toxin, domoic acid, in crab tissue. We find evidence that large vessels had a greater ability to mitigate losses from the HAB events. Thus, the proportion of total revenue going to small-vessel operators and the proportion of small-vessel participation in the fishery fell in response to the HAB events in several California fishing ports. Our results, therefore, offer empirical evidence that climate impacts on fishing communities are not uniform and offer insights into potential alternative adaptation strategies for different ocean user groups.",2020,,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,176,,,WOS:000556782100001,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106691,,#443,Jardine 2020,"",heatwave

Phenological and distributional shifts in ichthyoplankton associated with recent warming in the northeast Pacific Ocean,"Auth, TD; Daly, EA; Brodeur, RD; Fisher, JL","Understanding changes in the migratory and reproductive phenology of fish stocks in relation to climate change is critical for accurate ecosystem-based fisheries management. Relocation and changes in timing of reproduction can have dramatic effects upon the success of fish populations and throughout the food web. During anomalously warm conditions (1-4 degrees C above normal) in the northeast Pacific Ocean during 2015-2016, we documented shifts in timing and spawning location of several pelagic fish stocks based on larval fish samples. Total larval concentrations in the northern California Current (NCC) during winter (January-March) 2015 and 2016 were the highest observed since annual collections first occurred in 1998, primarily due to increased abundances of Engraulis mordax (northern anchovy) and Sardinops sagax (Pacific sardine) larvae, which are normally summer spawning species in this region. Sardinops sagax and Merluccius productus (Pacific hake) exhibited an unprecedented early and northward spawning expansion during 2015-16. In addition, spawning duration was greatly increased for E. mordax, as the presence of larvae was observed throughout the majority of 2015-16, indicating prolonged and nearly continuous spawning of adults throughout the warm period. Larvae from all three of these species have never before been collected in the NCC as early in the year. In addition, other southern species were collected in the NCC during this period. This suggests that the spawning phenology and distribution of several ecologically and commercially important fish species dramatically and rapidly changed in response to the warming conditions occurring in 2014-2016, and could be an indication of future conditions under projected climate change. Changes in spawning timing and poleward migration of fish populations due to warmer ocean conditions or global climate change will negatively impact areas that were historically dependent on these fish, and change the food web structure of the areas that the fish move into with unforeseen consequences.",2018,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,24,1,259-272,WOS:000426506100050,10.1111/gcb.13872,,#456,Auth 2018,"",ecosystem response; heatwave; indicators
Effects of the 2013-2016 warm anomalies on the California Current phytoplankton,"Gómez-Ocampo, E; Gaxiola-Castro, G; Burazo, R; Beier, E","Anomalies occurring in the California Current System during 2013-2016 were examined using remote sensing data and in-situ measurements. Positive anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST, up to 4 degrees C) and absolute dynamic topography (ADT, up to 20 cm), as well as negative anomalies in satellite chlorophyll concentration (CHL, up to -3.0 mg m(-3)) were recorded. In-situ temperature anomalies in August 2014 increased equatorward, from 2 degrees C along the northernmost line (CalCOFI hydrographic line 76.7) to 10 degrees C (below similar to 80 m depth) at the southernmost hydrographic line (off Baja California). In-situ negative Chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha) surface anomalies were similar in most of the lines examined (similar to -1.5 mg m(-3)), but for the CalCOFI lines, larger anomalies (similar to 3.5 mg m(-3)) were recorded. As a result of increased stratification, mirrored in the increase in mean monthly ADT and the upper water-column temperature, the 2003-2016 CHL time series showed a declining trend in phytoplankton production and biomass, which was particularly pronounced during the last four years in the central and southern zones of the California Current System. The mechanisms responsible for this trend seem to be related to a climate shift from cold to warm in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, as evidenced by large correlations between the CHL anomalies and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Multivariate ENSO Index, and Oceanic El Nino indices. Generalized additive models were used to explore the relationship between stratification and the decline in phytoplankton production. Two ADT ranges-characteristic of either highly dynamic or stratified environments-were defined, both of which led to a drop in primary production. The effects of these environments have been associated with the photo acclimation of phytoplankton to irradiance and nutrient availability regimes, by which primary production and biomass decrease due to the limitation of either of these factors. This study reveals some of the effects of the warm anomalies occurring from 2013 to 2016 in the California Current ecosystem, which will help to understand changes in higher trophic levels in this region.",2018,,DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY,151,,64-76,WOS:000444930400006,10.1016/j.dsr2.2017.01.005,,#459,Gómez-Ocampo 2018,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Warm Events Induce Loss of Resilience in Organic Carbon Production in the Northeast Pacific Ocean,"Bif, MB; Siqueira, L; Hansell, DA","Between 2013 and 2016, a series of warm events induced by ocean atmosphere oscillations negatively impacted productivity in the northeast Pacific Ocean. For two consecutive winters (2013-2014 and 2014-2015), suppressed wind stress and warm near-surface ocean temperature anomalies restricted vertical mixing between the surface and underlying nutrient-enriched waters. Here we assess historical data of sea surface temperature and sea level pressure, along with nearly a decade of biogeochemical float data to evaluate the impact of these warm events on organic carbon production. The first stratified winter experienced little apparent impact on the magnitude of net organic carbon production in the growing season relative to prior years, suggesting an immediate resilience from reduced new nutrients, apparently depending on recycled iron. However, the subsequent winter experienced virtually zero net production; a loss of resilience, perhaps due to net iron removal with export, was evident. We find that consistently enhanced winter stratification decreased carbon production much more so than a single warm winter.

Phytoplankton biomass responses to a marine heat wave align with altered nitracline depth,"Landry, MR; Freibott, AL; Beatty, JL; Selph, KE","The 2014-2015 warm anomaly (aka ""the Blob""), the largest of periodic and intensifying marine heat wave (MHW) perturbations in the northeast Pacific, may provide some insight about the future warmer ocean. Here, we use mixed-layer carbon estimates for total phytoplankton, major size classes and functional groups from 45 CalCOFI cruises to: (1) compare 2014-2015 MHW impacts in the southern California Current System to baseline estimates from 2004 to 2013 and (2) to test a space-for-time exchange hypothesis that links biomass structure to variability of nitracline depth (NCD). Seasonal and inshore-offshore analyses from nine stations revealed almost uniform 2 degrees C MHW warming extending 700 km seaward, fourfold to sixfold declines in nitrate concentration and 18-m deeper NCDs. Phytoplankton C decreased 16-21% compared to 45-65% for Chl a, with the threefold difference due to altered C : Chl a. Among size classes, percent composition of nanoplankton decreased and picophytoplankton increased, driven by higher Prochlorococcus biomass, while Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes generally declined. Diatom and dinoflagellate C decreased in both onshore and offshore waters. Seasonally, the MHW delayed the normal winter refresh of surface nitrate, resulting in depressed stocks of total phytoplankton and nanoplankton, Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes during winter. Consistent with the space-for-time hypothesis, biomass variations for baseline and MHW cruises followed similar (not significantly different) slope relationships to NCD. All biomass components, except Prochlorococcus, were negatively related to NCD, and community biomass structure realigned according to regression slopes differences with NCD variability.

Compared with the mean annual cycle (2008-2015), our study period was characterized by warmer waters, nitrate-impoverished, and with very low Chl-a concentration, which was closely associated with strong stratification and reduced upwelling conditions off nBC. Temperature anomalies were >2.0 degrees C by the end of 2014 when the marine heatwave prevailed, decreased during the spring-early summer upwelling season of 2015, and returned to >2.5 degrees C by the end of 2015 when El Nino appeared along the coast of nBC. As in 2008-2012 and closely coupled with upwelling, a seasonal cycle of total Chl-a was recorded under these abnormally warm conditions. However, relative to the mean annual cycle, total Chl-a and nitrate concentrations were significantly reduced (19%-55% and 40%-81%, respectively), with negative anomalies throughout the study period. Moreover, the seasonal evolution of the size-fractionated Chl-a concentration showed that smaller cells (<5 mu m) systematically contributed with the largest fraction (>60%) of the total Chl-a. Our findings indicate that the sequential occurrence of the marine heatwave in 2014 and El Nino in 2015 had a significant and sustained impact limiting the nitrate supply and reducing the total Chl-a in nearshore waters off nBC.

Ecosystem impacts of marine heat waves in the northeast Pacific,"Wyatt, AM; Resplandy, L; Marchetti, A","Marine heat waves (MHWs) are a recurrent phenomenon in the northeast Pacific that impact regional ecosystems and are expected to intensify in the future. Prior work showed that these events, including the 2014-2015 ""warm blob "", are associated with widespread surface nutrient declines in the subpolar Alaska Gyre (AG) and the North Pacific Transition Zone (NPTZ) but reduced chlorophyll concentrations in the NPTZ only. Here we explain the contrast between these two regions using a global ocean biogeochemical model (MOM6-COBALT) with Argo float and ship-based observations to investigate how MHWs influence marine productivity. We find that phytoplankton and zooplankton production respond relatively modestly to MHWs in both regions. However, differences in the response to seasonal iron and nitrogen limitation between large (> 10 mu m) and small (< 10 mu m) phytoplankton size classes explain the differences in ecosystem response to MHWs across the two biomes. During MHWs, reduced nutrient supply limits large phytoplankton production in the NPTZ (-13 % annually) but has a limited impact on the already iron-limited large phytoplankton population in the AG (-2 %). In contrast, MHWs yield a springtime increase in small phytoplankton in both regions due to shallower mixed layers and weaker light limitation. These modest changes are in apparent contradiction with prior estimates suggesting a collapse in net community production during the warm blob. We show, however, that 70 % of the decline in net community production previously calculated from nitrate Argo data can be attributed to artifacts in the method and that only 30 % can be attributed to interannual variability, in line with our model-based results. Although modest, the primary production anomalies associated with MHWs modify the phytoplankton size distribution, resulting in a significant shift towards small phytoplankton production (i.e., lower large-to-small-phytoplankton ratio) and reduced secondary and export production, especially in the NPTZ.",2022,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,19,24,5689-5705,WOS:000898905100001,10.5194/bg-19-5689-2022,,#467,Wyatt 2022,"",ecosystem response; heatwave

To determine how steelhead respond to such major shifts in temperature, we compared diet composition, stomach fullness, size, and body condition of juvenile steelhead collected in 2015 and 2016 to those of a subset of steelhead collected in previous surveys (2001, 2002, 2004, and 2006-2011) that included warm, cool, and neutral ocean years. In addition, we used bioenergetics models to assess the importance of the marine environment in contributing to changes in steelhead condition under different ocean temperature scenarios. Steelhead from 2015 and 2016 exhibited some of the poorest body condition values but were the largest sizes across all years evaluated. Steelhead diet composition varied between warm and cold years and between warm and average years, with steelhead consuming more insects, juvenile rockfishes, and rare and unidentified fish in warm years. Unusual taxa, including gelatinous salps (2015 and 2016) and juvenile smelts (2016), were consumed during Blob-influenced years. Bioenergetics models indicated that interannual variability in growth was influenced by changes in temperature and feeding conditions in the marine environment, with significant differences in growth between warm and cold ocean years apparent as early as day 2 of the simulated marine residence. These findings highlight the potential for warm ocean years to influence the diet composition and morphology of Columbia River steelhead populations and may lead to a better understanding of factors influencing survival of juvenile steelhead during early marine residence.",2020,,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,149,4,369-382,WOS:000544404900001,10.1002/tafs.10244,,#474,Thalmann 2020,"",ecosystem response; heatwave

Wintertime marine extreme temperature events modulate phytoplankton blooms in the North Pacific through subtropical mode water,"Tak, YJ; Song, H; Park, JY","Marine extreme temperature events (METs), including marine heatwaves (MHWs) and cold spells, have recently gained much attention owing to their vital influence on the marine ecosystem and social economy. Since METs can alter the upper ocean stratification and wintertime convective mixing in the northwestern North Pacific subtropical gyre (NPSG), their activities may modulate phytoplankton blooms by regulating entrainment of the subtropical mode water (STMW) with high NO3-. Furthermore, because STMW formed in the previous winter reemerges east of its formation site in the following winter, the METs activities imprinted in STMW affect phytoplankton blooms remote from its formation site. Here, we examined the relationship between the MET activities, STMW volume, and phytoplankton blooms using satellite observations and a data-assimilative coupled physical-biogeochemical model dataset. MET activities appearing in the STMW formation region during winter regulate the formation of STMW and the supply of NO3- from the subsurface, with the latter controlling the spring/autumn blooms in that region under NO3--limited conditions. Subsequently, this water mass is transported eastward in the subsurface within the northern flank of the NPSG before reemerging east of the STMW formation site the following spring. This process results in a negative lag-correlation between MET activities and surface chlorophyll in the reemergence region; for example, MHWs in winter at the STMW formation site tend to lower the surface chlorophyll concentration one year later in the reemergence region. Our study suggests that the oceanic processes allow one year of predictability of the marine ecosystems by monitoring METs in the STMW formation site.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,17,9,,WOS:000854077600001,10.1088/1748-9326/ac8e8a,,#484,Tak 2022,"",heatwave; physical drivers

While prolonged temperature stress can accelerate host-pathogen interactions, the outcomes in nature are poorly quantified. We monitored eelgrass wasting disease (EWD) from 2013-2017 and correlated mid-summer prevalence of EWD with remotely sensed seawater temperature metrics before, during, and after the 2015-2016 marine heatwave in the northeast Pacific, the longest marine heatwave in recent history. Eelgrass shoot density declined by 60% between 2013 and 2015 and did not recover. EWD prevalence ranged from 5-70% in 2013 and increased to 60-90% by 2017. EWD severity approximately doubled each year between 2015 and 2017. EWD prevalence was positively correlated with warmer temperature for the month prior to sampling while EWD severity was negatively correlated with warming prior to sampling. This complex result may be mediated by leaf growth; bigger leaves may be more likely to be diseased, but may also grow faster than lesions, resulting in lower severity. Regional stressors leading to population declines prior to or early in the heatwave may have exacerbated the effects of warming on eelgrass disease susceptibility and reduced the resilience of this critical species.",2021,,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,679,,47-58,WOS:000728098900004,10.3354/meps13902,,#488,Groner 2021,"",ecosystem response; heatwave

Given the global nature of these mass coral mortality events, recent studies argue that mitigating climate change is the only path to conserve coral reefs.

Local factors such as high abundance of macroalgae or urchins magnified coral loss in the year after bleaching.

Isopycnal Shoaling Causes Interannual Variability in Oxygen on Isopycnals in the Subarctic Northeast Pacific,"Cervania, AA; Hamme, RC","Over 60 years of oceanographic observations from Ocean Station Papa (OSP) in the northeast Pacific indicate faster dissolved oxygen loss than the global average. The greatest negative trends in oxygen concentration occur on isopycnals in the upper water column (sigma theta = 26.1-26.8 kg m-3, similar to 110-200 m) but have considerable uncertainty due to natural variability. In this paper, we use eight Argo profiling floats equipped with optode oxygen sensors to assess the 2008-2016 interannual variability of subsurface dissolved oxygen near OSP. We developed a method using high frequency Conductivity-Temperature-Depth data to correct optode profiles for slow response times and used reference profiles from the OSP time series to calibrate the optodes. Response time correction markedly improves subsurface bias caused by slow optode equilibration. Our analysis indicates that episodic shoaling of isopycnals can cause rapid reduction in dissolved oxygen concentration. Changes in ventilation, horizontal mixing, and water mass age are unlikely drivers for the rapid O2 loss events examined. We link dissolved oxygen loss during shoaling events to organic matter export, due to higher concentrations of organic matter and greater respiration rates at shallower depths. Reduced net community production during the ""Blob"" marine heatwave may have reduced the impact of the second shoaling event examined. Natural variations in dissolved oxygen in these layers provide context for uncertainty estimates of long-term trends and insight toward the potential for future extreme oxygen minima from the combined impact of the long-term decline and episodic shoaling.Oxygen dissolved in the ocean is declining worldwide as temperatures increase. Widespread ecological stress and altered marine chemistry will be a likely result. The subarctic northeast Pacific Ocean has been losing oxygen even faster than the global average rate. In this study, we use data from ocean observing robots in this region to investigate factors causing episodes of faster oxygen depletion. To do this accurately, we developed and applied a method to correct the data for how slowly the oxygen sensor responds as it moves upward through the water column. We identify two periods of rapid oxygen loss in subsurface water layers of about 1.5 years each. Both episodes happen when regional wind patterns cause these water layers to move closer to the surface. When shallower, these layers experience faster oxygen consumption by respiration, because the supply of organic detritus from the surface is higher. Such oxygen depletion episodes, driven by periodic wind shifts, can be regarded as natural variations in the ocean's oxygen content and need to be considered when interpreting the potential for long-term anthropogenic trends.We observe two episodes of rapid oxygen loss in the upper pycnocline of the NE Pacific coincident with isopycnal shoaling We propose enhanced respiration at shallower depths as the most likely driver of oxygen declines during these shoaling events High-frequency Conductivity-Temperature-Depth data can be used to obtain float ascent velocities to correct oxygen optode lag",2024,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,129,7,,WOS:001272468700001,10.1029/2023JC020414,,#496,Cervania 2024,Helen Killeen (2025-08-01 09:15:12)(Select): compound due to discussion of effects occurring during the 2014-2016 marine heatwave in the NE Pacific; ,compound event; deoxygenation; ecosystem response; physical drivers
Compound marine cold spells and hypoxic events in a nearshore upwelling system,"Walter, RK; Dalsin, M; Mazzini, PLF; Pianca, C","Prolonged periods of extreme warm and cold seawater temperature anomalies, known as marine heatwaves (MHWs) and marine cold spells (MCSs), respectively, can have significant impacts on coastal marine ecosystems. Prior research has examined the co-occurrence of multiple extremes [low dissolved oxygen (DO) and/or low pH] during MHWs, with the impact of these compound events potentially exceeding that of a single stressor due to synergistic effects. However, we are not aware of any studies that have examined compound extreme events during MCSs, despite the ecosystem implications. Along Eastern Boundary Current Upwelling Systems (EBUS), strong-wind driven upwelling has led to reduced warming trends and persistence of MCSs, as well as an increased seasonal risk for coastal hypoxia via the cross-shelf advection of cold, low DO subthermocline waters. In this short communication, we investigated for the first time compound MCS-hypoxic events at a nearshore site in central California using several decades of nearshore water temperature data, short-term nearshore DO data, and several decades of DO data from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations program. From 1988 to 2020, we identified 55 MCS events, with 50 events (-90.9%) initiated during anomalously strong upwelling. Using long-term temperature -DO relationships, we identified 20 of the 55 MCS events (-34.6%) as potential compound MCS-hypoxic events, with an average duration of 11.7 days. These compound events occurred almost exclusively during the major upwelling season (March to June) when there is a high propensity for the advection of cold, low DO subthermocline waters from the adjacent shelf into the nearshore. This work provides the first known investigation into the co-occurrence of MCS and hypoxic events in a nearshore upwelling system and provides a baseline for assessing future changes to these compound events in a changing climate, with important implications for ecosystem health in EBUS globally.",2024,,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,300,,,WOS:001208358300001,10.1016/j.ecss.2024.108706,,#499,Walter 2024,"",cold spell; deoxygenation; physical drivers
Atypical Red Blood Cells Are Prevalent in California Sea Lion Pups Born during Anomalous Sea Surface Temperature Events,"Flores-Morán, A; Banuet-Martínez, M; Elorriaga-Verplancken, FR; García-Ortuño, LE; Sandoval-Sierra, J; Acevedo-Whitehouse, K","To date, there is limited knowledge of the effects that abnormal sea surface temperature (SST) can have on the physiology of neonate pinnipeds. However, maternal nutritional deficiencies driven by alimentary restrictions would expectedly impact pinniped development and fitness, as an adequate supply of nutrients is essential for growth and proper functioning of all body systems, including red blood cell synthesis and clearance. Here, we investigated red blood cell morphology of California sea lion (CSL) pups from the San Benito Archipelago born during the 2014 and 2015 anomalously high SST events recorded in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. We examined whether atypical erythrocyte morphologies were more common in 2015, when the high SST event was more pronounced, and whether the stable isotope signature of pup fur, as an indicator of maternal feeding strategies, accounted for the number of atypical cells. Various atypical erythrocyte morphologies were more prevalent and more abundant than reference values. Evidence of iron deficiency was found in both years, and only pups born in 2014 showed evidence of active erythropoiesis. Microcytes and reticulocytes were more common in pups with higher isotopic delta C-13 and lower delta N-15 values, suggesting a probable relationship between maternal feeding strategies and the effect of climatic anomalies on red blood cell physiology of their pups. As developing pinnipeds require increased oxygen storage capacity for diving and foraging, the presence of atypical erythrocytes could be relevant to CSL pup fitness if the underlying cause is not reverted.

In the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), the community dynamics of forage populations have been studied at regional spatial scales, but not across regions. To evaluate indicators of the forage community at the ecosystem-wide scale, we examine temporal variability of forage assemblages in Northern (Oregon/Washington), Central (California; Point Reyes to Monterey Bay) and Southern (southern California) regions of the CCLME from 1998 through 2016 which include years with unprecedented climate variability. Forage communities fluctuated greatly between years within each region owing to regionally low abundances of common taxa in at least some years (e.g., rockfishes Sebastes spp. in each region). Comparison of species assemblages among regions indicate that that temporal shifts in assemblage structure were largely synchronous throughout the CCLME. However, dynamics of most individual taxa were out of phase between regions, indicating that different taxa drove the variability in each region. Within regions, taxa with similar adult ecological niches tended to co-vary, suggesting synchronous responses to environmental forcing. Major changes in forage assemblage structure are descriptively linked to large oceanographic perturbations such as the transition from El Nino to La Nina conditions in 1998, anomalous upwelling in 2005, and the onset of a large marine heatwave in fall-winter 2013-2014. Changes in forage assemblage structure are reflected in prey switching in the diet of California sea lions, Zalophus californianus, in the Southern region. The multivariate forage indices that we develop can serve as effective indicators of regional forage community composition shifts in the CCLME and provide managers with context on spatio-temporal changes in the structure of forage fish communities important to top predators in this system.",2019,,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,105,,215-228,WOS:000490574200020,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.05.057,,#509,Thompson 2019,"",ecosystem response; heatwave

The recent warm period was dominated by warmwater gelatinous invertebrates and fishes, some of which were previously either extremely rare or absent. Mixing of organisms originating from more southern or western regions with those previously present in the NCC may have resulted in novel and unpredictable trophic interactions that produced some of the observed changes in relative abundance.

Widespread ciliate and dinoflagellate mixotrophy may contribute to ecosystem resilience in a subarctic sea: the northern Gulf of Alaska,"Strom, SL; Bright, KJ; Fredrickson, KA","Mixotrophy among ciliates and dinoflagellates in the northern Gulf of Alaska (NGA) was widespread during spring and summer, with mixotrophs contributing a median of 38 to 61% of total ciliate plus dinoflagellate biomass depending on season and year. The proportional contribution of mixotrophs was higher during a heatwave year (2019) than during a year of average temperatures (2018). The most common mixotrophic ciliates included Mesodinium spp. and several of 8 observed Strombidium species, while for dinoflagellates, the most common mixotrophs were Gymnodinium-like cells and Tripos (formerly Ceratium) spp. Onshore-offshore distribution gradients were seen mainly in summer when elevated freshwater inputs create a horizontal salinity gradient. A nearshore mixotroph assemblage consisted of nutritionally related Mesodinium spp. and dinoflagellate Dinophysis, as well as Tripos spp., while an offshore assemblage included Tontonia-like ciliates and dinoflagellates including Gymnodinium-like cells and Torodinium robustum. An 11 yr time series with lower taxonomic resolution revealed seasonality in some taxa and showed near-complete loss of Mesodinium spp. and Tontonia-like species during the longer 2014-2016 North Pacific marine heatwave.

"If it ain't broke, don't fix it: variable foraging behaviour is associated with low kittiwake reproductive success","Schlener, J; Whelan, S; Hatch, S; Guigueno, MF; Elliott, KH","Repeated use of a winning foraging strategy can be profitable when individuals use memory to return to successful food patches. However, in environments where patches are unpredictable, variable foraging behaviour may be more profitable. To test this idea, we explored how individual variation in foraging trip characteristics impacts breeding success in black-legged kittiwakes, Rissa tridactyla, on Middleton Island, Alaska, U.S.A., during a period of highly variable environmental conditions, the largest recorded marine heatwave. As anticipated, foraging trip characteristics were highly variable, within and between years and individuals. While characteristics of foraging trips alone did not influence annual breeding success, both age and variance in those trip characteristics explained variation in breeding success. Specifically, individuals with smaller variance in foraging trip characteristics among trips were more likely to fledge a chick. There was a maximum distance threshold in foraging implying that individuals searched within a restricted area, increasing foraging time rather than distance when searching was not profitable, and providing additional support for the idea that kittiwakes are most successful when foraging in known areas rather than exploring new areas. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is associated with large scale shifts between cold and warm ocean climate and ecosystem regimes in the region, impacted breeding success but did not change foraging behaviour. However, mean breeding success decreased as mean time spent resting and in area-restricted search (intensive search) on foraging trips during incubation increased. Based on nearly a decade of data, we conclude that smaller variability in behaviour, even during challenging foraging conditions, enhances breeding success. As climate change and marine heatwaves continue to increase in intensity, individuals more variable in foraging behaviour may be unable to compensate.

Here, we test for systematic change in tidepool fish communities between recent and historical data sets, which include the North Pacific marine heatwave of 2014-2016. Location Periodic sampling occurred since 1966 at study site isolated from human activities on the Pacific west coast of Vancouver Island, Canada. Methods Repeated fish sampling at seven wave-exposed rocky shore tidepools was conducted on 8 (historical: 1966-1993) and 5 (recent: 2012-2016) occasions during low tide using methods that capture all individuals present (including cryptic and rare species). Species were subsequently identified using standard taxonomic approaches and abundances recorded. These data comprised the basis for analyses of both community-level and species-specific responses to test for differences in the historical and recent time periods. Results We did not detect systematic increases or declines in species density, total abundance of fishes within tidepools and community similarity between historical and recent sampling events in high-intertidal pools. However, fish communities from low-shore pools decreased in the number of species present, overall abundance and community similarity. Those species lost from the lower pools were non-resident rare species typical of subtidal environments. By contrast, a warm-affinity crevice kelpfish was observed only recently. We also found that six species had higher or lower abundances between historical and recent sampling events, and one species occurred at higher vertical heights. Main conclusion Fish communities in high-intertidal pools were resilient between historical and recent sampling periods, and lacked evidence of invasion. However, some signals of community and species changes were evident in the lower shore.

Range-Wide Comparison of Gray Whale Body Condition Reveals Contrasting Sub-Population Health Characteristics and Vulnerability to Environmental Change,"Torres, LN; Bird, C; Rodriguez-Gonzalez, F; Christiansen, F; Bejder, L; Lemos, L; Swartz, S; Willoughby, A; Hewitt, J; Bierlich, K","Climate change is a global phenomenon, yet impacts on resource availability to predators may be spatially and temporally diverse and asynchronous. As capital breeders, whales are dependent on dense, predictable prey resources during foraging seasons. An Unusual Mortality Event (UME) of Eastern North Pacific (ENP) gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) was declared in 2019 due to a dramatic rise in stranded animals, many emaciated. Climate change impacts may have affected prey availability on the primary foraging grounds of ENP gray whales (~20,000 individuals) in the Arctic and sub-Arctic region and in coastal habitats between northern California, USA and British Columbia, Canada where a small sub-group of ENP whales called the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG; ~230 individuals) forages. To investigate variability of gray whale body condition relative to changing ocean conditions, we compare two datasets of gray whale aerial photogrammetry images collected via Unoccupied Aircraft Systems (UAS) on the ENP wintering grounds in San Ignacio Lagoon, Mexico (SIL; n=111) and on the PCFG feeding grounds in Oregon, USA (n=72) over the same three-year period (2017-2019). We document concurrent body condition improvement of PCFG whales in Oregon while body condition of whales in SIL declined. This result indicates that the UME may have affected ENP whales due to reduced energetic gain on some Arctic/sub-Arctic foraging grounds, while PCFG whales are recovering from poor prey conditions during the NE Pacific marine heatwave event of 2014-2016. Surprisingly, we found that PCFG whales in Oregon had significantly worse body condition than whales in SIL, even when accounting for year and phenology. We derive support for this unexpected finding via photogrammetry analysis of opportunistic aerial images of gray whales on Arctic foraging grounds (n=18) compared to PCFG whales in Oregon (n=30): the body condition of PCFG whales was significantly lower (t=2.96, p=0.005), which may cause PCFG whales to have reduced reproductive capacity or resilience to environmental perturbations compared to ENP whales.

"Dietary Plasticity Mitigates Impacts to Reproduction for the Gull-billed Tern <i>Gelochelidon nilotica</i> During Abnormally Warm Sea Surface Temperature Events in California, USA","Goodenough, KS; Patton, RT; Lorda, J","Large scale oceanic processes can have profound consequences for marine and coastal food webs. Mortality and reproductive related impacts to seabirds have been documented for decades, and current research suggests that dietary flexibility may be a key component by which birds can mitigate environmental variation. Our motivation for this research was to better understand how a dietary generalist in the coastal environment responds to changes in prey food availability. The Gull-billed Tern Gelochelidon nilotica is a coastal nesting species that has an opportunistic generalist diet. We monitored both tern diet and density of a main prey resource to examine how responsive these terns are to annual variation in prey resources. Our results documented that the loss of a ubiquitous prey resource did not appear to influence tern annual reproductive success even though, in some years, Emerita analoga comprised greater than 70% of Gull-billed Tern diet. During breeding seasons with warmer than average sea surface temperatures, the Gull-billed Tern switched to a more terrestrial diet and focused aquatic foraging activities upon crustacean species that are more tolerant of warmer water temperatures.

The interannual response of euphausiid community structure and abundance were investigated during the cold-warm transition period (June) of six years (2013-2019, except 2015) in the central Gulf of California, Mexico. Abundance in June 2013-2019 was compared with historical baseline for euphausiid abundance made in June 1957 from a California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation cruise, just before El Nin similar to o 1957-1958. During 2014-2019 two anomalously warm events occurred: the marine heat wave of 2014 (MHW 2014) and El Nin similar to o 2015-2016 (May 2015-May 2016). We tested the hypothesis that the numerically dominant subtropical neritic species Nyctiphanes simplex and temperate oceanic Nematoscelis difficilis significantly decrease in abundance in response to the prolonged warming that occurred during 2014-2016 and that tropical euphausiid species could increase in relative abundance during this period. Ten euphausiid species were collected accounting for < 3% of total relative abundance of 34 zooplankton taxonomic groups collected during June 2013-2014, 2016, 2018 and between 7 and 22.4% during 2017 and 2019. N. simplex and Ne. difficilis accounted for > 80% of euphausiid total abundance during June 2013-2019, with considerably lower abundance during 2013, the MHW 2014, and El Nin similar to o 2015-2016 than in June 2017, 2018, and 2019. Mean euphausiid abundance in 2017 and 2019 was slightly higher than that recorded in June 1957. Tropical species increased their relative abundances during El Nin similar to o 2015-2016 event, but they were always < 15% of total euphausiid relative abundance during 2013-2019. We estimated that it took at least 3 years for the euphausiid species abundance in the gulf to slowly recover from the unfavorable conditions associated with MHW 2014, and El Nin similar to o 2015-2016 to attain highest mean abundance in 2019.

Climate Extreme Seeds a New Domoic Acid Hotspot on the US West Coast,"Trainer, VL; Kudela, RM; Hunter, MV; Adams, NG; McCabe, RM","A heatwave that blanketed the northeast Pacific Ocean in 2013-2015 had severe impacts on the marine ecosystem through altered species composition and survival. A direct result of this marine heatwave was a sustained, record-setting harmful algal bloom (HAB), caused by the toxigenic diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia, that led to an unprecedented delay in harvest opportunity for commercial Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister) and closure of other recreational, commercial and tribal shellfish harvest, including razor clams. Samples collected during a cruise in summer 2015, showed the appearance of a highly toxic ""hotspot"" between Cape Mendocino, CA and Cape Blanco, OR that was observed again during cruises in the summers of 2016-2018. The transport of toxic cells from this retentive site northward during wind relaxations or reversals associated with storms resulted in economically debilitating delay or closure of Dungeness crab harvest in both northern California and Oregon in 2015-2019. Analyses of historic large-scale Pseudo-nitzschia HABs have shown that these events occur during warm periods such as El Nino, positive phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, or the record-setting-marine heatwave. In order to reduce the impacts of large-scale HABs along the west coast of North America, early warning systems have been developed to forewarn coastal managers. These early warning systems include the Pacific Northwest and California HAB Bulletins, both of which have documented elevated domoic acid and increased risk associated with the northern California hotspot. These early warnings enable mitigative actions such as selective opening of safe harvest zones, increased harvest limits during low risk periods, and early harvest in anticipation of impending HAB events. The aims of this study are to show trends in nearshore domoic acid along the US west coast in recent years, including the recent establishment of a new seed bed of highly-toxic Pseudo-nitzschia, and to explore how early warning systems are a useful tool to mitigate the human and environmental health and economic impacts associated with harmful algal blooms.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE,2,,,WOS:001024575500001,10.3389/fclim.2020.571836,,#547,Trainer 2020,"",heatwave

However, where natural climate aberrations mask or amplify the impacts of anthropogenic climate change, identifying key detrimental changes is challenging. In these situations, long-term, systematic field studies allow the consequences of anthropogenically driven climate change to be distinguished from the expected fluctuations in natural resources. In this study, we describe fluctuations in encounter rates for humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, between 2008 and 2018. Encounter rates were assessed during transect surveys of the Au'Au Channel, Maui, Hawaii. Initially, rates increased, tracking projected growth rates for this population segment. Rates reached a peak in 2013, then declined through 2018. Specifically, between 2013 and 2018, mother-calf encounter rates dropped by 76.5%, suggesting a rapid reduction in the reproductive rate of the newly designated Hawaii Distinct Population Segment of humpback whales during this time. As this decline coincided with changes in the Pacific decadal oscillation, the development of the NE Pacific marine heat wave and the evolution of the 2016 El Nino, this may be another example of the impact of this potent trifecta of climatic events within the North Pacific.",2019,,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,6,3,,WOS:000465470300023,10.1098/rsos.181463,,#556,Cartwright 2019,Helen Killeen (2025-08-01 07:47:15)(Select): speculative; ,ecosystem response; heatwave

However, values of delta 15N and delta 13C differed in 2014, 2018, and 2021 relative to other years, suggesting shifts to distant regions in latitude and longitude, and increased foraging effort during the post-molting migrations of these warm years.

The first EOF and PC of SST has proven to be such a useful metric of variability in the North Pacific that it is called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We find that the period of persistent marine heatwaves beginning in 2014 caused a fundamental change to the first EOF and PC of SST (calculated using data from 1950 to 2021) as compared to the established PDO spatial pattern (calculated using data from 1950 to 1993).

Results show that elevated temperatures and salinity caused a shift in planktonic food availability toward smaller taxa. These trophic changes did not affect food accumulation by oyster larvae or their fatty acid composition but did affect post-metamorphosis success, with up to 24% fewer young metamorphosed postlarvae at some sites and no development of juveniles at all sites. This resulted in the failure of oyster recruitment and in the development of tubeworms, a trophic and spatial competitor that can better ingest small particles.

A Dynamic Stress-Scape Framework to Evaluate Potential Effects of Multiple Environmental Stressors on Gulf of Alaska Juvenile Pacific Cod,"Blaisdell, J; Thalmann, HL; Klajbor, W; Zhang, Y; Miller, JA; Laurel, BJ; Kavanaugh, MT","Quantifying the spatial and temporal footprint of multiple environmental stressors on marine fisheries is imperative to understanding the effects of changing ocean conditions on living marine resources. Pacific Cod (Gadus macrocephalus), an important marine species in the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem, has declined dramatically in recent years, likely in response to extreme environmental variability in the Gulf of Alaska related to anomalous marine heatwave conditions in 2014-2016 and 2019. Here, we evaluate the effects of two potential environmental stressors, temperature variability and ocean acidification, on the growth of juvenile Pacific Cod in the Gulf of Alaska using a novel machine-learning framework called ""stress-scapes,"" which applies the fundamentals of dynamic seascape classification to both environmental and biological data. Stressscapes apply a probabilistic self-organizing map (prSOM) machine learning algorithm and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) analysis to produce distinct, dynamic patches of the ocean that share similar environmental variability and Pacific Cod growth characteristics, preserve the topology of the underlying data, and are robust to nonlinear biological patterns. We then compare stress-scape output classes to Pacific Cod growth rates in the field using otolith increment analysis. Our work successfully resolved five dynamic stress-scapes in the coastal Gulf of Alaska ecosystem from 2010 to 2016. We utilized stress-scapes to compare conditions during the 2014-2016 marine heatwave to cooler years immediately prior and found that the stress-scapes captured distinct heatwave and non-heatwave classes, which highlighted high juvenile Pacific Cod growth and anomalous environmental conditions during heatwave conditions. Dominant stress-scapes underestimated juvenile Pacific Cod growth across all study years when compared to otolith-derived field growth rates, highlighting the potential for selective mortality or biological parameters currently missing in the stress-scape model as well as differences in potential growth predicted by the stress-scape and realized growth observed in the field. A sensitivity analysis of the stress-scape classification result shows that including growth rate data in stress-scape classification adjusts the training of the prSOM, enabling it to distinguish between regions where elevated sea surface temperature is negatively impacting growth rates. Classifications that rely solely on environmental data fail to distinguish these regions. With their incorporation of environmental and non-linear physiological variables across a wide spatio-temporal scale, stress-scapes show promise as an emerging methodology for evaluating the response of marine fisheries to changing ocean conditions in any dynamic marine system where sufficient data are available.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000656549400001,10.3389/fmars.2021.656088,,#581,Blaisdell 2021,"",ecosystem response; heatwave

Long-term means indicated that high productivity occurred along the coastal zone where upwelling occurs, and in a semi-permanent cyclonic gyre off Punta Eugenia. At the seasonal scale, the variability of integrated primary production showed differences with respect to integrated chlorophyll a variability. Integrated chlorophyll a exhibited maximum values during the coastal upwelling season in spring and summer, while minimum values occurred during the inflow of tropical-subtropical waters south of Punta Eugenia in autumn and winter. In contrast, the highest values of integrated primary production occurred in spring and summer to the north of Punta Eugenia, whereas to the south of this location, the highest values occurred in winter and autumn. This seasonal variability was associated with phytoplankton size and maximum photosynthetic rates. At the interannual scale, low productivity was associated with increased stratification during the subarctic water intrusion events and the ""Blob"" and El Nino events in 2015-2016.

Decline of one of the southernmost northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) colonies and its relationship with a warm sea environment,"Rodríguez-Rafael, ED; García-Aguilar, MD; Galván-Magaña, F; Elorriaga-Verplancken, FR",". Over several decades, air temperature and sea surface temperature (SST) have increased in the northeastern Pacific, as has the frequency of large-scale warm anomalies in SST. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of these warm anomalies on the production of northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris; NES) pups from the colony of the San Benito Archipelago, located in the central-western region of the Baja California Peninsula. Pup and adult female counts from the 2002 to 2019 breeding seasons were compiled to determine the trend in the abundance of the colony and its current state. In addition, birth rate variations during the study period were assessed. Likewise, the presence of warm anomaly events in the SST in the potential foraging area of adult females (PFA) was analyzed. The San Benito colony decreased at an average annual rate of 3.6% from 2002 to 2019, with an estimated abundance of 4,723 individuals (95% CI: 3,821-5,615) in 2019. However, the birth rate remained constant (mean 0.68 & PLUSMN; 0.08), even though several warm anomaly events associated with El Nino and The Blob phenomena were detected in the PFA.

Mass coral bleaching due to unprecedented marine heatwave in Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (Northwestern Hawaiian Islands),"Couch, CS; Burns, JHR; Liu, G; Steward, K; Gutlay, TN; Kenyon, J; Eakin, CM; Kosaki, RK","2014 marked the sixth and most widespread mass bleaching event reported in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, home to the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (PMNM), the world's second largest marine reserve. This event was associated with an unusual basin-scale warming in the North Pacific Ocean, with an unprecedented peak intensity of around 20 degrees C-weeks of cumulative heat stress at Lisianksi Island. In situ bleaching surveys and satellite data were used to evaluate the relative importance of potential drivers of bleaching patterns in 2014, assess the subsequent morality and its effects on coral communities and 3D complexity, test for signs of regional acclimation, and investigate long-term change in heat stress in PMNM. Surveys conducted at four island/atoll (French Frigate Shoals, Lisianski Island, Pearl and Hermes Atoll, and Midway Atoll) showed that in 2014, percent bleaching varied considerably between islands/atolls and habitats (back reef/fore reef and depth), and was up to 91% in shallow habitats at Lisianski. The percent bleaching during the 2014 event was best explained by a combination of duration of heat stress measured by Coral Reef Watch's satellite Degree Heating Week, relative community susceptibility (bleaching susceptibility score of each taxon * the taxon's abundance relative to the total number of colonies), depth and region. Mean coral cover at permanent Lisianski monitoring sites decreased by 68% due to severe losses of Montipora dilatata complex, resulting in rapid reductions in habitat complexity. Spatial distribution of the 2014 bleaching was significantly different from the 2002 and 2004 bleaching events likely due to a combination of differences in heat stress and local acclimatization. Historical satellite data demonstrated heat stress in 2014 was unlike any previous event and that the exposure of corals to the bleaching-level heat stress has increased significantly in the northern PMNM since 1982, highlighting the increasing threat of climate change to reefs.",2017,,PLOS ONE,12,9,,WOS:000411980300037,10.1371/journal.pone.0185121,,#588,Couch 2017,"",ecosystem response; heatwave

Their subsequent northern range expansion is linked to larval transport in the Davidson Current to northern California (1993), southern Oregon (approximately 1996), the Oregon and Washington coastal estuaries and the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia (1998). Range expansions through larval transport to the central British Columbia coast occurred before 2010, to Haida Gwaii in 2020, and into the inland Salish Sea in 2015 and 2016. Both the range expansions of C. maenas and local abundance are strongly linked to oceanic factors during their larval development. These include (1) strong northward flow of coastal waters during winter; (2) warm surface water temperatures (>10 degrees C for larval development); and (3) coastal circulation patterns that keep larvae close to shore, where they can be carried by wind and tidal currents into estuaries and embayments to settle. The strongest year classes and largest range expansions occurred during the last two major El Nino events. The 1997 to 1998 El Nino resulted in the colonization of embayments in Oregon, coastal Washington, and on the west coast of Vancouver Island, while the El Nino of 2015 to 2016 and the Pacific Warm Blob are linked to the range expansion into the Salish Sea.

Harmful Algal Blooms: Identifying Effective Adaptive Actions Used in Fishery-Dependent Communities in Response to a Protracted Event,"Moore, KM; Allison, EH; Dreyer, SJ; Ekstrom, JA; Jardine, SL; Klinger, T; Moore, SK; Norman, KC","The ""blob"" of anomalously warm surface water that persisted in the North Pacific Ocean from 2013 to 2016 resulted in a massive harmful algal bloom (HAB) of Pseudo-nitzschia along the entire United States West Coast. The bloom produced record-breaking concentrations of domoic acid, a marine neurotoxin, that contaminated seafood and necessitated fisheries harvest closures beginning in May 2015. The subsequent closures were unprecedented in length and geographic extent, generating an economic shock for fishing communities. We sought to identify effective adaptive actions used in fishery-dependent communities in response to this event. Using survey data collected across 16 fishing communities following the 2015 HAB event, we empirically identified factors affecting an individual's: (1) absolute magnitude of income loss, (2) likelihood of income loss recovery, and (3) severity of emotional stress. Our findings indicate that individuals who suffered greater absolute income losses were exposed to longer fisheries closures, more dependent on shellfish as a source of income, and employed in the fishing industry. Income diversification was an effective strategy for reducing and/or recovering HAB related income losses. Advertising was also found to be an effective income recovery strategy, but for fishers it was associated with increased emotional stress. If increasing the adaptive capacity of fishery-dependent coastal communities to HAB events is a policy goal, then costs to adaptive action such as emotional stress, limited access to alternate fisheries, new fishing gear, a lack of alternate job skills or access to job networks, and a lack of advertising know-how will need to be addressed.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,6,,,WOS:000508596800001,10.3389/fmars.2019.00803,,#595,Moore 2020,"",heatwave; resource management; social impact
Hindcasted Body Temperatures Reveal Underestimated Thermal Stress Faced by Intertidal Species,"Ma, LX; Wang, J; Denny, MW; Dong, YW","AimAs global climate changes, there is a clear mismatch between the temporal and spatial characteristics of body temperature and environmental temperature, confounding the assessment of thermal stress for organisms in many ecological studies. Here, we hindcast the hourly body temperatures of intertidal molluscs to explore the differences between them and environmental temperatures (air and water temperatures) in multiple metrics of thermal stress.LocationIntertidal shores in East Asia (0 degrees-45 degrees N, 100 degrees E-140 degrees E).Time Period40 years, 1980 to 2019.Major Taxa StudiedMollusca.MethodsWe collected habitat zonation data and measured the morphological characteristics of 25 intertidal molluscs living in East Asia. For three different types of intertidal molluscs (i.e., bivalves, limpets and snails), we built corresponding heat budget models (HBMs) to hindcast the hourly body temperatures from 1980 to 2019. We analysed the thermal stress of intertidal species faced in three metrics, annual extreme high temperatures (T99), seasonal daily maximum temperatures (DMT) and heatwaves, and compared them with environmental temperatures.ResultsWe found that T99 of body temperatures and their interannual warming rates are significantly higher than those of environmental temperatures. Moreover, there were non-negligible mismatches between the seasonal thermal pattern and heatwaves of body temperatures and environmental temperatures, suggesting that the deleterious impacts of global warming on intertidal species are underestimated and cannot be directly revealed by environmental temperatures.Main ConclusionsThermal stress patterns of body temperature were significantly different from those of environmental temperature, and the thermal stress faced by intertidal species had been persistently underestimated. These results emphasise that body temperature should be used as the appropriate metric for evaluating and predicting the impacts of global warming and weather extremes in the intertidal biological system.",2024,,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,33,11,,WOS:001306129500001,10.1111/geb.13908,,#598,Ma 2024,"KAREN HUNTER (2025-08-22 08:11:16)(Select): This one is interesting and a little tricky.

Interannual variability (2014-2016) of coastal mesoscale activity at the entrance of the Gulf of California as determined by remote sensing,"Trasviña-Castro, A; Torres-Hernández, MY; Valle-Rodríguez, J; González-Rodríguez, E","Early in 2014, the waters at the entrance of the Gulf of California experienced exceptionally high sea surface temperature (2-4 degrees C above normal) and coincided with a period of unusually weak winds. The warm anomalies continued after March with the arrival of the Warm Blob (2014) and subsequent 2014-2015 El Nino. Our objective was to investigate how the combination of atypical winter winds and unusual heat advection patterns affected regional upwelling by evaluating the variability in coastal sea level and remotely sensed chlorophyll (CHL). The sea level anomaly (SLA) time series for 2014 contained a weak winter minimum and two successive SLA peaks instead of a single summer maximum. The first peak was due to anomalously weak winds. Another double peak was recorded the following summer. The consequences of such anomalous patterns on the productivity of the region were severe. Large oceanic regions at the entrance to the Gulf of California maintained very low CHL concentrations for three consecutive years. Notably, coastal CHL reached record-low values from 2003 to 2016. At two upwelling sites, we found a remarkable association between the CHL mean and CHL variance. High/low variance corresponded to high/low monthly mean CHL. We attributed this to the excess/lack of mesoscale variability associated with upwelling zones, which affected offshore filaments. The low CHL variance at the coast confirms what is apparent from the CHL fields of the southern Gulf of California and its entrance. Not only was coastal productivity low, but weak coastal upwelling led to fewer offshore filaments, effectively inhibiting the transport of the limited amount of coastal primary production to the oceanic domain.",2024,,REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE,77,,,WOS:001255211100001,10.1016/j.rsma.2024.103609,,#606,Trasviña-Castro 2024,Rob Suryan (2025-10-16 17:04:21)(Select): No luck with journal access or finding a full text online; KAREN HUNTER (2025-09-10 06:40:27)(Select): study on the effect of MHW/warm anomalies on phyiscal ocean features (upwelling); ,heatwave; physical impact
"Seasonality and response of ocean acidification and hypoxia to major environmental anomalies in the southern Salish Sea, North America (2014-2018)","Alin, SR; Newton, JA; Feely, RA; Siedlecki, S; Greeley, D","Coastal and estuarine ecosystems fringing the North Pacific Ocean are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification, hypoxia, and intense marine heatwaves as a result of interactions among natural and anthropogenic processes. Here, we characterize variability during a seasonally resolved cruise time series (2014-2018) in the southern Salish Sea (Puget Sound, Strait of Juan de Fuca) and nearby coastal waters for select physical (temperature, T ; salinity, S ) and biogeochemical (oxygen, O 2 ; carbon dioxide fugacity, f CO 2 ; aragonite saturation state, omega arag ) parameters. Medians for some parameters peaked ( T , omega arag ) in surface waters in summer, whereas others ( S , O 2 , f CO 2 ) changed progressively across spring-fall, and all parameters changed monotonically or were relatively stable at depth. Ranges varied considerably for all parameters across basins within the study region, with stratified basins consistently the most variable. Strong environmental anomalies occurred during the time series, allowing us to also qualitatively assess how these anomalies affected seasonal patterns and interannual variability. The peak temperature anomaly associated with the 2013-2016 northeast Pacific marine heatwave-El Nino event was observed in boundary waters during the October 2014 cruise, but Puget Sound cruises revealed the largest temperature increases during the 2015-2016 timeframe. The most extreme hypoxia and acidification measurements to date were recorded in Hood Canal (which consistently had the most extreme conditions) during the same period; however, they were shifted earlier in the year relative to previous events. During autumn 2017, after the heat anomaly, a distinct carbonate system anomaly with unprecedentedly low omega arag values and high f CO 2 values occurred in parts of the southern Salish Sea that are not normally so acidified. This novel ""CO 2 storm"" appears to have been driven by anomalously high river discharge earlier in 2017, which resulted in enhanced stratification and inferred primary productivity anomalies, indicated by persistently and anomalously high O 2 , low f CO 2 , and high chlorophyll. Unusually, this CO 2 anomaly was decoupled from O 2 dynamics compared with past Salish Sea hypoxia and acidification events. The complex interplay of weather, hydrological, and circulation anomalies revealed distinct multi-stressor scenarios that will potentially affect regional ecosystems under a changing climate. Further, the frequencies at which Salish cruise observations crossed known or preliminary species' sensitivity thresholds illustrates the relative risk landscape of temperature, hypoxia, and acidification anomalies in the southern Salish Sea in the present day, with implications for how multiple stressors may combine to present potential migration, survival, or physiological challenges to key regional species.

"Interannual variability in the trophic status and water quality of Bahia Magdalena, Mexico, during the 2015-2018 period: TRIX","Cervantes-Duarte, R; Jimenez-Quiroz, MD; Funes-Rodriguez, R; Hernandez-Trujillo, S; Gonzalez-Armas, R; Anaya-Godinez, E","The Trophic Index (TRIX) was computed monthly, from January 2015 to December 2018, for ten sites in Bahia Magdalena, Baja California Sur. Hydrobiological variables showed interannual and seasonal variations in the shallow and deep zones of the lagoon. The chlorophyll-a (Chla) was the variable with fewest significant correlations (P < 0.05) during the study period. A significant decrease in TRIX was observed in 2015, compared to all other years, likely related to the effects of warming events such as ``El Nino'' and ``The Blob'' (defined as a large mass of relatively warm water in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of North America) in the region. TRIX values in the winter-spring (January to June) were generally higher than those in summer-autumn (July-December) due to the prevailing NW winds that cause coastal upwelling and shallow water mixing, making nutrients available in the lagoon. There was a marked stratification of the water column in the second half of the year that made the surface layer nutrient-poor. We found a high and significant correlation (r = 0.66, P < 0.05) between TRIX values and water relative density in the deep zone of the lagoon, denoting the effect of subsurface oceanic water on nutrient concentrations. At the local scale, TRIX values in the shallow zone were generally lower than in the deep zone, but these differences reached statistical significance only in 2018. The monthly average TRIX (5.9 +/- 0.2) denotes a high trophic level and mediocre water quality. Although TRIX values might have some shortcomings, these results can be used as an early warning for the relevant stakeholders and authorities. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Western Gull Foraging Behavior as an Ecosystem State Indicator in Coastal California,"Cimino, MA; Shaffer, SA; Welch, H; Santora, JA; Warzybok, P; Jahncke, J; Schroeder, I; Hazen, EL; Bograd, SJ","With accelerating climate variability and change, novel approaches are needed to warn managers of changing ecosystem state and to identify appropriate management actions. One strategy is using indicator species-like seabirds as ecosystem sentinels-to monitor changes in marine environments. Here, we explore the utility of western gulls (Larus occidentalis) breeding on Southeast Farallon Island as a proxy of ecosystem state in coastal California by investigating the interannual variability in gull foraging behavior from 2013 to 2019 in relation to upwelling conditions, prey abundances, and overlap with humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) as gulls frequently feed in association with whales. Western gulls have a flexible diet and forage on land and at-sea. We combined gull GPS tracking data during the incubation phase, ecosystem survey data on multiple predator and prey species, and derived oceanographic upwelling products. When foraging at sea, gulls overlapped with cool upwelled waters. During 2015-2017, 25% more gull foraging trips visited land than in other years, where land trips were on average similar to 8 h longer and 40% further than sea trips, which coincided with high compression of coastally upwelled waters (habitat compression) in 2015-2016. Gull foraging behavior was related to local prey abundances, where more foraging occurred near shore or on land when prey abundances were low. However, visual surveys indicated that similar to 70% of humpback whale observations co-occurred with gulls, and the year with the most foraging on land (2017) corresponded to regionally low relative whale abundances, suggesting gull movement patterns could be an indicator of whale presence. Further, both whales and gulls forage near-shore under high upwelling habitat compression and low krill abundance. Hence, the deployment of year-round tags on gulls with the capability of near real-time data accessibility could provide important fine-scale metrics for conservation and management of the threatened yet recovering eastern Pacific humpback whale population between infrequent and coarse surveys. Entanglement in fishing gear and ship strikes are major inhibitors to whale recovery and have increased concomitantly with human use of ocean resources. Moreover, as climate variability and change increase, novel indicators should be explored and implemented to inform marine spatial planning and protect species across multiple scales from new risks.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000759312600001,10.3389/fmars.2021.790559,,#615,Cimino 2022,"",ecosystem response; heatwave; indicators
Quantifying the effects of extreme events and oceanographic variability on the spatiotemporal biomass and distribution of two key euphausiid prey species,"Evans, R; English, PA; Gauthier, S; Robinson, CLK","Euphausiids form a critical component of oceanic food chains and individual species vary in their responses to perturbation events. We aimed to establish if patterns of fine scale oceanographic variability and larger-scale climate events such as marine heatwaves (MHWs) could be linked with spring variability in the biomass of two key forage species in the northeast Pacific Ocean, Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera. To achieve this, we used long-term datasets from the west coast of Vancouver Island Canada, an important commercial fishing area, to first quantify interannual signals of variability in fine-scale oceanographic conditions using multivariate analysis. We then used geostatistical spatiotemporal modelling to quantify the effects on species-specific euphausiid biomass. Oceanographic data showed that the effects of warm events are not always observable, and effects vary across small spatial scales. Warming due to the 2014-2016 MHW was relatively mild on the continental shelf during spring (<1 degrees C above climatology). Spring biomass of euphausiids, particularly E. pacifica, peaked in 2015, and all euphausiid groups analysed (E. pacifica, T. spinifera and total euphausiids) exhibited significant correlations with positive phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. These results have implications for marine predators as euphausiids may act as system stabilisers in the northeast Pacific, thereby potentially increasing ecosystem resilience during extreme events.",2023,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,10,,,WOS:000928655300001,10.3389/fmars.2023.1031485,,#617,Evans 2023,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
Global trends in the frequency and duration of temperature extremes,"La Sorte, FA; Johnston, A; Ault, TR","Anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and duration of extreme climate events, including extreme heat events (EHE) and extreme cold events (ECE). How the frequency and duration of both EHE and ECE have changed over time within both terrestrial and marine environments globally has not been fully explored. Here, we use detrended daily estimates of minimum and maximum temperature from the ERA5 reanalysis over a 70-year period (1950-2019) to estimate the daily occurrence of EHE and ECE across the globe. We measure the frequency and duration of EHE and ECE by season across years and estimate how these measures have changed over time. Frequency and duration for both EHE and ECE presented similar patterns characterized by low spatial heterogeneity and strong seasonal variation. High EHE frequency and duration occurred within the Antarctic during the austral summer and winter and within the Arctic Ocean during the boreal winter. High ECE frequency and duration occurred within the Nearctic and Palearctic during the boreal winter and the Arctic Ocean during the boreal summer. The trend analysis presented pronounced differences between frequency and duration, high spatial heterogeneity, especially within terrestrial environments, and strong seasonal variation. Positive EHE trends, primarily in duration within marine environments, occurred during the boreal summer within the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and during the austral summer within the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. The eastern tropical Pacific contained positive EHE and ECE trends, primary in duration during the boreal winter.

Research efforts and fisheries surveys have long sought to provide greater insights on both the environmental drivers, and the fisheries and ecosystem consequences, of this variability. Here, variability in the temporal and spatial abundance and distribution patterns of young-of-the-year (YOY) rockfishes are described based on midwater trawl surveys conducted throughout the coastal waters of California Current between 2001 and 2019. Results confirm that the abundance of winter-spawning rockfish taxa in particular is highly variable over space and time. Although there is considerable spatial coherence in these relative abundance patterns, there are many years in which abundance patterns are very heterogeneous over the scale of the California Current. Results also confirm that the high abundance levels of YOY rockfish observed during the 2014-2016 large marine heatwave were largely coastwide events.

The Gulf of California subpopulation within the entire metapopulation (= subspecies) comprises the majority of nesting (similar to 76% of P. o. californicus). The US classifications were based on pollution effects in the Southern California Bight (SCB) during the early 1970s; official listing-recognition in Mexico (NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010) occurred in 2010 and it continues. Unfortunately, Brown Pelican conservation across the US/Mexico border has been largely uncoordinated. Recent declines in the SCB subpopulation are not well-documented, whereas representative subpopulations in the Gulf of California have received continual study since the US listing. Until the early 2000s, Gulf pelican breeding populations changed little. El Nino/Southern Oscillation continues to be a major factor driving annual pelican breeding intensity and success, with a slightly weaker effect to the north. Nest attempts (NA) in the southern Midriff zone and to the south of our monitoring zone have declined in the last decade, in especially extreme and unprecedented ways in a period of unusual warming in the last 3 years (2014-2016), termed by some as the ""Blob"". Other factors (such as human disturbance and commercial fishing) have likely exacerbated recent warming effects in some areas. Recent data also suggest the pelican is in a process of minor range-shifting toward the northern Gulf, and there are no definitive indications of a recent NA decline in that zone.

Subsurface Temperature Anomalies Off Central Oregon During 2014-2021,"Cervantes, BT; Fewings, MR; Risien, CM","We use moored observations in 80 m water depth at the NH-10 site along the historic Newport Hydrographic Line from 1999 to 2021 to calculate water temperature anomalies at the surface, near surface, and bottom. Analysis is focused on the subsurface temporal and spatial characteristics of marine heatwaves (MHWs) during 2014-2016 and 2019-2020 on the continental shelf and slope. Warm anomalies extend throughout the water column in fall/winter 2014-2016 when winds are predominantly downwelling-favorable, while the 2019-2020 period is characterized by shallower summer and fall anomalies on the shelf. Sustained temperature anomalies during the bottom MHW in late 2016 are the largest in the NH-10 time series. Analysis of temporal patterns in wind stress during MHW and non-MHW periods shows the onset of upwelling-favorable winds interrupts warm events.

Fine-scale vertical distribution and diel migrations of <i>Pyrosoma atlanticum</i> in the northern California Current,"Lyle, JT; Cowen, RK; Sponaugle, S; Sutherland, KR; Koski, M","Blooms of the colonial pelagic tunicate Pyrosoma atlanticum in 2014-2018 followed a marine heatwave in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Pyrosome blooms could alter pelagic food webs of the northern California Current (NCC) by accelerating the biological pump via active transport, fecal pellet production and mortality events. Although aggregations of P. atlanticum have the potential to shape marine trophic dynamics via carbon export, little is known about pyrosome vertical distribution patterns. In this study, we estimated the distribution of P. atlanticum in the NCC along transects off of Oregon (45 degrees N and 124 degrees W) and northern California (41 degrees N and 124 degrees W), USA during February and July 2018. Depth-stratified plankton tows provided volume-normalized pyrosome abundance and biovolume estimates that complemented fine-scale counts by a vertically deployed camera system. Pyrosomes were numerous offshore during February, especially off Oregon. Colonies were distributed non-uniformly in the water column with peak numbers associated with vertical gradients in environmental parameters, notably density and chl-a.

Climate shock effects and mediation in fisheries,"Fisher, MC; Moore, SK; Jardine, SL; Watson, JR; Samhouri, JF","Climate shocks can reorganize the social-ecological linkages in food-producing communities, leading to a sudden loss of key products in food systems. The extent and persistence of this reorganization are difficult to observe and summarize, but are critical aspects of predicting and rapidly assessing community vulnerability to extreme events. We apply network analysis to evaluate the impact of a climate shock-an unprecedented marine heatwave-on patterns of resource use in California fishing communities, which were severely affected through closures of the Dungeness crab fishery. The climate shock significantly modified flows of users between fishery resources during the closures. These modifications were predicted by pre-shock patterns of resource use and were associated with three strategies used by fishing community member vessels to respond to the closures: temporary exit from the food system, spillover of effort from the Dungeness crab fishery into other fisheries, and spatial shifts in where crab were landed. Regional differences in resource use patterns and vessel-level responses highlighted the Dungeness crab fishery as a seasonal ""gilded trap"" for northern California fishing communities. We also detected disparities in climate shock response based on vessel size, with larger vessels more likely to display spatial mobility.

Benthic megafauna assemblage change over three decades in the abyss: Variations from species to functional groups,"Kuhnz, LA; Ruhl, HA; Huffard, CL; Smith, KL","Megafaunal seafloor assemblages on the Monterey Fan in the NE Pacific (Station M, 4000 m depth) were studied between 2006-2018 using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) as part of a continuing time-series study that began in 1989. Since 2006 we identified nearly 120,000 individual animals representing over 142 morphospecies, and observed continuous changes in the megafaunal assemblage. This study, which tracked variation in observed morphospecies over a 13-year period, is one of the most detailed long-term records of megafaunal change for abyssal depths. Our investigation shows that new variations continued to emerge, reinforcing the concept that the deep-sea is dynamic over short time scales, rather than static over long periods. Some species were uncommon, but later observed in high numbers, then decreased to very low or undetectable levels (e.g. Elpidia sp. A), while others (e.g. Psychropotes longicauda) exhibited a relatively persistent presence with less fluctuation in abundance. Decreasing total echinoderm density from 2013-2018 did not correspond with the continued occurrence of large episodic POC flux events between 2016-2018. This may be attributed to the quality of food supply arriving at the seafloor and the varied ability of organisms to utilize it. Long-term tracking (30 years) of 10 specific epibenthic echinoderm species originally quantified from camera-sled images shows a pattern of assemblage structure, perhaps returning toward the composition observed in the 1990s and early 2000s. Many questions remain as to how this abyssal site and others will change with continued, and potentially increasing, anthropogenic change in the upper ocean. For example, the marine heat anomaly known as the 'Warm Blob' may have influenced major ecological processes at the abyssal seafloor in terms of morphospecies and functional group composition due to changes in POC flux.

Satellite-derived phytoplankton biomass and production variability in 2 contrasting coastal areas: off southern California and off northern Baja California,"Mirabal-Gómez, U; Alvarez-Borrego, S; Lara-Lara, JR","In order to compare phytoplankton biomass (satellite-derived chlorophyll, Chl(sat)) and production (PP), and sea surface temperature (SST) between the regions north and south of the Ensenada Front, time series were generated from satellite imagery for 250-km transects perpendicular to the coast: one off La Jolla (TLJ), southern California (USA), and the other off San Quintin Bay (TSQB), Baja California (Mexico). Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST and Chlsat monthly composites and PP monthly composites were used for the 2002-2016 period.

Impacts of Physical and Biological Processes on Spatial and Temporal Variability of Particulate Organic Carbon in the North Pacific Ocean during 2003-2017,"Yu, J; Wang, XJ; Fan, H; Zhang, RH","The North Pacific Ocean is a significant carbon sink region, but little is known about the dynamics of particulate organic carbon (POC) and the influences of physical and biological processes in this region at the basin scale. Here, we analysed high-resolution surface POC data derived from MODIS-Aqua during 2003-2017, together with satellite-derived sea surface chlorophyll and temperature (SST). There are large spatial and temporal variations in surface POC in the North Pacific. Surface POC is much lower in the subtropical region (<50 mg m(-3)) than in the subarctic region (>100 mg m(-3)), primarily resulting from the south-to-north variability in biological production. Our analyses show significant seasonal and interannual variability in surface POC. In particular, there is one peak in winter-spring in the western subtropical region and two peaks in late spring and fall in the western subarctic region. Surface POC is positively correlated with chlorophyll (r = similar to 1) and negatively correlated with SST (r = similar to-0.45, P < 0.001) south of 45 degrees N, indicating the strong influence of physically driven biological activity on the temporal variability of POC in the subtropical region. There is a significantly positive but relatively lower correlation coefficient (0.6-0.8) between POC and chlorophyll and an overall non-significantly positive correlation between POC and SST north of 45 degrees N, reflecting the reduction in the POC standing stock due to the fast sinking of large particles. The climate modes of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, El Nino-Southern Oscillation and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation have large impacts on POC in various seasons in the subtropical region and weak influences in the subarctic region.

We examined changes in kelp communities at 5 sites along the Olympic Coast of Washington State, USA, during and following the recent perturbations of anomalous warm-water events and sea star wasting syndrome (SSWS). Anomalously warm water in 2013 and 2014 corresponded with a loss of approximately 50% of Macrocystis pyrifera and Nereocystis luetkeana canopy. However, the canopy quickly recovered, and stipe density increased after 2015. Purple sea urchins Strongylocentrotus purpuratus increased in density 164-fold, largely at one site, but this increase was first observed in 2017 and peaked in 2019, after the warm period. Sea stars did not show recovery from SSWS, with several species including Pycnopodia helianthoides continuing to decline. The majority of variation in assemblage structure occurred at the site level for kelps, macroinvertebrates, and fishes, while year explained most of the variability for juvenile rockfishes Sebastes spp. We did not see strong top-down effects of urchins on kelp, suggesting that top-down impacts were not dominant regionally during this period. In contrast, we found evidence for a bottom-up influence of kelp habitat on juvenile rockfishes, as rockfish recruits occurred with higher probability where kelp stipe density was higher.

"Seasonal variation of zooplankton abundance and community structure in Prince William Sound, Alaska, 2009-2016","McKinstry, CAE; Campbell, RW","Large calanoid copepods and other zooplankters comprise the prey field for ecologically and economically important predators such as juvenile pink salmon, herring, and seabirds in Prince William Sound (PWS). From 2009-2016, the Gulf Watch Alaska program collected zooplankton 5-10 times each year at 12 stations in PWS to establish annual patterns. Surveys collected 188 species of zooplankton with Oithona similis, Limacina helicina, Pseudocalanus spp., and Acartia longiremis as the most common species present in 519 samples. Generalized additive models assessed seasonal abundance and showed peak abundance in July (mean: 9826 no. m(-3) (95% CI: 7990-12,084]) and lowest abundance in January (503 no. m(-3) [373 to 678]). Significantly higher zoo plankton abundance occurred in 2010 (542 no. M-3 +/- 55 SE) and lowest in 2013 (149 no. m(-3) +/- 13). The species composition of communities, determined via hierarchical cluster analysis and indicator species analysis, produced six distinct communities based on season and location. The winter community, characterized by warm water indicator species including Mesocalanus tenutcornis, Calanus pacificus, and Corycaeus cmglicus, diverged into four communities throughout the spring and summer. The first spring community, characterized by copepods with affinities for lower salinities, occurred sound-wide. The second spring community, comprised of planktonic larvae, appeared sporadically in PWS bays in 2011-2013. Spring and summer open water stations were defined by the presence of large calanoid copepods. A summer community including the most abundant taxa was common in 2010 and 2011, absent in 2013, then sporadically appeared in 2014 and 2015 suggesting interannual variability of zooplankton assemblages. The zooplankton community shifted to a uniform assemblage characterized by cnidarians in the early autumn. Community assemblages showed significant correlations to a set of environmental variables including SST, mixed layer depth, location, depth Of chlorophyll-alpha max, mixed layer average salinity, chlorophyll-alpha maximum, and bottom depth (p = 0.24, p < 0.05). The disappearance of the summer community coincided with the appearance of the Gulf of Alaska warm water anomaly known as ""The Blob"".

Laysan albatross exhibit complex behavioral plasticity in the subtropical and subarctic North Pacific Ocean,"Gilmour, ME; Felis, J; Hester, M; Young, L; Adams, J","Animals that regularly traverse habitat extremes between the subtropics and subarctic are expected to exhibit foraging behaviors that respond to changes in dynamic ocean habitats, and these behaviors may facilitate adaptations to novel and changing climates. During the chick-provisioning stage, Laysan albatross Phoebastria immutabilis parents regularly undertake short- and long-distance foraging trips throughout the vast central North Pacific Ocean. We examined GPS tracking data among chick-provisioning albatrosses in Hawai'i to characterize habitats during short- and long-distance trips. The study period encompassed a marine heatwave (2014) and the cooling period after an extreme El Nino event (2016), enabling us to examine foraging habitats under novel and changing climates. First passage time and generalized additive mixed models indicated that during 183 short and 110 long trips (n = 32 birds), wind-assisted flight efficiency, proximity to productive areas, and moonlit-searching were important in both subtropical and subarctic habitats. Laysan albatross took foraging trips that had similar lengths and durations in 2014 and 2016 and visited similar areas, indicating that their foraging range did not expand in response to climatic variability. A strategy that uses similar foraging areas across years combined with reliance on environmental processes that enhance flight efficiency (wind) and that enable searching behaviors (moonlight) indicate that Laysan albatross exhibit complex behavioral plasticity that allows them to utilize subtropical and subarctic habitats affected by dynamic climate variability. This strategy may benefit their ability to respond to oceanographic and climatic change, including expanding warm water regions and changing atmospheric conditions influenced by global warming.",2022,,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,697,,125-147,WOS:000865793900010,10.3354/meps14148,,#658,Gilmour 2022,"",ecosystem response; heatwave
"Exposure of whales to entanglement risk in Dungeness crab fishing gear in Oregon, USA, reveals distinctive spatio-temporal and climatic patterns","Derville, S; Buell, TV; Corbett, KC; Hayslip, C; Torres, LG","Entanglement in fishing gear presents a major threat to marine mammals worldwide and a pressing concern for distinct populations of whales off the US West Coast. The lack of understanding of their fine-scale distribution in relation to fishing activity limits management efforts, specifically in Oregon. Based on year-round predictions of rorqual whale densities and fishing effort compiled from logbooks, we assess co-occurrence between commercial Dungeness crab fishing gear and whales over a decade (2011-2020) as an indicator of exposure to entanglement risk. Generalized Additive Models including temporal, climatic, and ocean upwelling predictors were used to investigate variations in exposure. Exposure peaked in April, at the onset of the upwelling season when whales were predicted to occur in greater numbers and closer to shore. Exposure remained constant until the end of the crab season in nearshore waters <40 fathoms (73 m) and decreased past these depths. Across years, exposure was lower during the marine heatwave (2014-2016) when fishing was more active nearshore and whales were predicted to be less abundant. Exposure was higher before (2011-2013) and after (2017-2020) the heatwave, which correspond to negative phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation associated with stronger upwelling, indicating more productive conditions favorable to whales. A recent increase in exposure was also due to a slight shift in fishing effort towards deeper waters. These findings illustrate the use of fine-scale species distribution models to assess space-use conflicts in dynamic marine ecosystems and can be used to guide fisheries management to reduce entanglement risk in Oregon.",2023,,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,281,,,WOS:000956102600001,10.1016/j.biocon.2023.109989,,#660,Derville 2023,"",heatwave; resource management
Population persistence of the perennial kelp Eisenia arborea varies across local spatial scales,"Gossard, DJ; Steller, DL","Perennial stipitate kelps are globally distributed and individual species can inhabit broad latitudinal ranges, express -ing notably longevous persistence. Despite the foundational role kelps provide to their communities, little is known about the variability in persistence of the stipitate kelps at local spatial scales. We studied the population persistence of Eisenia arborea, a heat-and wave force-tolerant perennial stipitate kelp with a distributional range extending from Brit-ish Columbia to south of the range limit of all other northeast Pacific kelps, in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Persistence characteristics for E. arborea among sites were compared and used to test the hypothesis that stand persistence varied at local spatial scales around Isla Natividad, a Pacific island off the Baja California peninsula with documented spatiotem-poral environmental heterogeneity. Collected individuals around the island were ""aged"" using the previously validated age estimation technique of counting annual cortical dark rings. After detecting no significant differences among sites in the covariation between estimated ages for collected individuals and stipe length, we utilized in-situ population-level stipe length measurements to more rapidly predict age structures within six stands around the island. Predicted age structures, and associated stand densities, revealed persistence characteristics and density varied at local scales and a strong positive relationship existed between stand density and stand mean and maximum ages.

Examining harmful algal blooms through a disaster risk management lens: A case study of the 2015 US West Coast domoic acid event,"Ekstrom, JA; Moore, SK; Klinger, T","The human dimensions of harmful algal blooms (HABs) are becoming increasingly apparent as they grow in frequency and magnitude in some regions of the world under changing ocean conditions. One such region is the U.S. West Coast, where HABs of toxigenic species of Pseudo-nitzschia have been found to coincide with or closely follow periods of warming. In 2015, the region experienced a massive HAB of Pseudo-nitzschia that was associated with the 2014-16 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave. The HAB event delayed the opening of the lucrative commercial Dungeness crab fishery for up to 5 months and closed the popular recreational razor clam fishery, resulting in fishery failures and disaster declarations and causing significant sociocultural and economic impacts to coastal communities. Here, management actions are examined that were taken by federal and state government agencies and responses of coastal residents to this extreme HAB event using a disaster risk management framework consisting of four phases: 1) prediction and early warning, 2) event response, 3) recovery and reconstruction, and 4) mitigation and prevention. Clear differences in management actions at the state level were evident in California, Oregon, and Washington during every phase, producing vastly different perceptions of management by coastal residents. A history of trusted relationships and coordination among agencies and with the fishing industry in Washington State was associated with more transparent and accepted management responses.

Regional warming exacerbates match/mismatch vulnerability for cod larvae in Alaska,"Laurel, BJ; Hunsicker, ME; Ciannelli, L; Hurst, TP; Duffy-Anderson, J; O'Malley, R; Behrenfeld, M","The match-mismatch hypothesis predicts that variability in spring primary production will increase starvation risk for marine fish populations. However, it is often unclear whether the synergic effects of temperature, phytoplankton phenology and metabolic demands of fish support these prediction within and across regions. In this study, we combine experimentally-derived rates of larval survival in relation to water temperature with satellite remote-sensing estimates of chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature to predict habitat quality of first feeding Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) larvae in two adjacent large marine ecosystems; southeast Bering Sea (BS) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Predictions are made from 1998 to 2019, a period comprised of both warm and cool springs, followed by a series of extreme warming events (heatwaves) beginning in 2014. Model results indicate that the drivers of a mismatch between cod larvae and their food is fundamentally different between the two systems. In the GOA, larval habitat suitability is highly dependent on interannual fluctuations in sea surface temperature that regulate yolk reserves in embryos. In contrast, larval habitat suitability in the BS was more sensitive to the onset of the surface expression of Chl a production. The combined effects of changes in timing of Chl a and increased metabolic demands of larvae were captured by the model during the GOA marine heatwave (2014-16, 2019), which predicted significant loss of larval habitat across the entire region.

Location California Current Ecosystem, USA. Methods We constructed generalized additive models based on cetacean sighting and environmental data from 1991 to 2009 for eight species with a diverse range of habitat associations. Models were built with three different sets of predictor variables to compare performance. Models were then used to forecast species abundance and distribution patterns during 2014, a year with anomalously warm ocean temperatures. Cetacean sighting data collected during 2014 were used to assess model forecasts. Results Ratios of model-predicted abundance to observed abundance were close to 1:1 for all but one species and accurately captured changes in the number of animals in the study area during the anomalous year. Predicted distribution patterns also showed good concordance with the 2014 survey observations. Our results indicate that habitat relationships were captured sufficiently to predict both changes in abundance and shifts in distribution when conditions warmed, for both cool- and warm-temperate species. Main conclusions Models built with multidecadal datasets were able to forecast abundance and distribution in a novel warm year for a diverse set of cetacean species.

In response, the Hawai'i Coral Bleaching Collaborative (HCBC) conducted 2,177 coral bleaching surveys across the Hawaiian Archipelago. The HCBC was established to coordinate bleaching monitoring efforts across the state between academic institutions, non-governmental organizations, and governmental agencies to facilitate data sharing and provide management recommendations. In 2019, the goals of this unique partnership were to: 1) assess the spatial and temporal patterns of thermal stress; 2) examine taxa-level patterns in bleaching susceptibility; 3) quantify spatial variation in bleaching extent; 4) compare 2019 patterns to those of prior bleaching events; 5) identify predictors of bleaching in 2019; and 6) explore site-specific management strategies to mitigate future bleaching events. Both acute thermal stress and bleaching in 2019 were less severe overall compared to the last major marine heatwave events in 2014 and 2015. Bleaching observed was highly site- and taxon-specific, driven by the susceptibility of remaining coral assemblages whose structure was likely shaped by previous bleaching and subsequent mortality. A suite of environmental and anthropogenic predictors was significantly correlated with observed bleaching in 2019. Acute environmental stressors, such as temperature and surface light, were equally important as previous conditions (e.g. historical thermal stress and historical bleaching) in accounting for variation in bleaching during the 2019 event. We found little evidence for acclimation by reefs to thermal stress in the main Hawaiian Islands. Moreover, our findings illustrate how detrimental effects of local anthropogenic stressors, such as tourism and urban run-off, may be exacerbated under high thermal stress.

Here, seasonal, interannual, and multidecadal variations are linked to regional weather and large-scale climate ocean-atmosphere dynamics. In the springtime, the Northeast Pacific subtropical high-pressure system strengthens, intensifying northwesterly alongshore winds. These winds drive coastal upwelling that fertilizes nearshore surface water with phytoplankton nutrients, resulting in a dramatic increase in biological productivity. Upwelling weakens over summer into fall, allowing nutrient-depleted offshore water to move toward the coast. Southerly winter storm winds deepen the mixed layer and further enhance onshore flow. El Nifio interrupts these seasonal cycles with varying intensity every three to eight years, but typically peaks during the low-productivity winter season, lessening its biological impact. Over the 1989-2016 period of observation, a negative phase of the multidecadal Pacific Decadal Oscillation is observed as a 15-year cool period following the strong 1997-1998 El Nifio. Two recently identified basin-scale phenomena, the central Pacific El Nifio Modoki and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, increased in strength during this period. In Monterey Bay, primary productivity increased substantially during the cool period, at about 3% per year. This shift also marked the beginning of a monotonic decline in subsurface oxygen, which decreased by 3% annually in the 300-400 m depth horizon, above the oxygen minimum zone. Anthropogenically driven increases in surface pCO(2) and acidity (pH) are notable in Monterey Bay in spite of high near-surface variability. Recently, over 2014-2016, Monterey Bay has warmed, interrupting the 1988-2012 cooling trend. Even with the warm years included, however, there is no overall increasing trend in temperature at any depth from 1988 to the present. A recompilation of historical temperature data back to 1929 indicates that over this longer period, average and cool years have not been significantly different, but warm episodes have been hotter over the last few decades, leading to a trend of increasing temperature over the past 89 years.

Here, we test the hypothesis that summertime (May-August) mesozooplankton communities are spatially-persistent across years of varying ocean conditions, including during the marine heatwave of 2014-2016. We use spatial ordinations and hierarchical clustering of Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) sampling over 17 years (2000-2016) to (1) characterize typical zooplankton communities in different regions of the GoA, and (2) investigate spatial structuring relative to variation in ocean temperatures and circulation. Five regional communities were identified, each representing distinct variation in the abundance of 18 primary zooplankton taxa: a distinct cluster of coastal taxa on the continental shelf north of Vancouver Island; a second cluster in the western GoA associated with strong currents and cold water east of Unimak Pass; a shelf break cluster rich in euphausiids found at both the eastern and western margins of the GoA; a broad offshore cluster of abundant pelagic zooplankton in the southern GoA gyre associated with stable temperature and current conditions; and a final offshore cluster exhibiting low zooplankton abundance concentrated along the northeastern arm of the subarctic gyre where ocean conditions are dominated by eddy activity. When comparing years of anomalous warm and cold sea surface temperatures, we observed change in the spatial structure in coastal communities, but little change (i.e., spatial persistence) in the northwestern GoA basin. Whereas previous studies have shown within-region variability in zooplankton communities in response to ocean climate, we highlight both consistency and change in regional communities, with interannual variability in shelf communities and persistence in community structure offshore. These results suggest greater variability in coastal food webs than in the central portion of the GoA, which may be important to energy exchange from lower to upper trophic levels in the meso-scale biomes of this ecosystem.",2021,,PLOS ONE,16,1,,WOS:000612929300152,10.1371/journal.pone.0244960,,#697,Hoover 2021,"KAREN HUNTER (2025-08-22 05:42:20)(Select): Including this paper: Focuses on understanding patterns resutling from an ECE, ""When comparing years of anomalous warm and cold sea surface temperatures, we observed change in the spatial structure in coastal communities, but little change (i.e., spatial persistence) in the northwestern GoA basin.

Whale shark abundance forecast: The interannual hotspot effect,"Jaramillo-Gil, S; Pardo, MA; Vázquez-Haikin, A; Bolaños- Jiménez, J; Sosa-Nishizaki, O","1. Each year, whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) aggregate in the northern Gulf of California at Bahia de los Angeles, a small coastal village that recently developed whale shark swimming as economic activity during the summer and autumn. Since the number of animals using the bay fluctuates annually, we aimed to predict it 1 month before each whale shark season. We based our modelling approach on the hypothesis that interannual warming conditions would spatially restrict whale shark habitats, triggering larger aggregations in areas that remain productive. 2. We photo--identified whale sharks while surface feeding in Bahia de los Angeles during a 13--year period, which allowed us to estimate a local abundance index per year through mark--recapture techniques. Then, we fitted these abundances as a function of several competing model structures, based on means of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll--a, as well as their interannual anomalies from the linear trend, during spring, within the best--known range of the species in the northern Gulf of California. 3. The results of the ecological model showed that whale sharks visit Bahia de los Angeles in larger numbers during extreme warming conditions, with relatively high surface chlorophyll--a concentrations, which was especially evident during the 2014--2016 northeast Pacific Marine Heatwave and El Nino. Presumably, the overall reduction in surface productivity associated with these events forced whale sharks to restrict their summer--autumn habitat to productivity hotspots, including Bahia de los Angeles. 4. Our model allowed us to predict the number of animals visiting the site before each season starts, which has crucial proactive management implications, such as allowing authorities to regulate the ecotourism effort dynamically to reduce the probability of ship strikes and/or excessive stress to the animals. We propose an abundance baseline from the prediction for neutral interannual conditions.5. Synthesis and applications.

Adaptive Behaviors to Marine Ecosystem Shifts: Examining Fishermen's Strategies in Response to Abundant Juvenile Sablefish (<i>Anoplopoma fimbria</i>) in Alaska,"Szymkowiak, M; Rhodes-Reese, M","Over recent years there have been rapid changes occurring across marine ecosystems worldwide, with high latitude systems seeing ecosystem shifts emerging at unprecedented rates. The Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea marine ecosystems have experienced substantial fluctuation in fish stocks, with some species experiencing considerable decreases while others thrive. Following the marine heatwave of 2014, sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) had a historically unparalleled juvenile recruitment class that is now dominating the stock composition. While this recruitment class bodes well for future fisheries, it is currently undermining the value of the fishery with limited incentives to retain the smaller and less valuable fish, compounding adverse effects on earnings in the fishery due to whale depredation that has been occurring for years. This study examines the well-being implications of fishermen's adaptive strategies to these ecosystem conditions within the Alaska sablefish fishery using a socioecological system framework, operationalized as a qualitative network model (QNMs) and quantitative indicators. We examine the extent to which adaptation strategies, derived from a literature review and stakeholder interviews, are being utilized in the fishery with quantitative indicators. These strategies are then examined with QNMs that explore their impacts across the spectrum of well-being. By coupling quantitative indicators and QNMs, we were able to demonstrate how adaptive strategies can be examined to capture the multi-faceted well-being effects of fisheries participants' adaptations to changing conditions. This study directly addresses several of the key guiding principles of the U.S. EBFM Road Map, including advancing our understanding of ecosystem processes, exploring trade-offs within an ecosystem, and maintaining resilient ecosystems, inclusive of community well-being. Thus this paper demonstrates how coupled socio-ecological models can elevate the inclusion of human adaptive behaviors, providing a framework for the development of policymaking that can mitigate adverse effects on both the participants and the resource by facilitating the mixture of adaptive strategies that maximizes desired well-being outcomes.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,7,,,WOS:000600698200001,10.3389/fmars.2020.602281,,#700,Szymkowiak 2020,"",resource management; social impact
A Decade of Death and Other Dynamics: Deepening Perspectives on the Diversity and Distribution of Sea Stars and Wasting,"Dawson, MN; Duffin, PJ; Giakoumis, M; Schiebelhut, LM; Beas-Luna, R; Bosley, KL; Castilho, R; Ewers-Saucedo, C; Gavenus, KA; Keller, A; Konar, B; Largier, JL; Lorda, J; Miner, CM; Moritsch, MM; Navarrete, SA; Traiger, SB; Turner, MS; Wares, JP","Mass mortality events provide valuable insight into biological extremes and also ecological interactions more generally. The sea star wasting epidemic that began in 2013 catalyzed study of the microbiome, genetics, population dynamics, and community ecology of several high-profile species inhabiting the northeastern Pacific but exposed a dearth of information on the diversity, distributions, and impacts of sea star wasting for many lesser-known sea stars and a need for integration across scales. Here, we combine datasets from single-site to coast-wide studies, across time lines from weeks to decades, for 65 species. We evaluated the impacts of abiotic characteristics hypothetically associated with sea star wasting (sea surface temperature, pelagic primary productivity, upwelling wind forcing, wave exposure, freshwater runoff) and species characteristics (depth distribution, developmental mode, diet, habitat, reproductive period). We find that the 2010s sea star wasting outbreak clearly affected a little over a dozen species, primarily intertidal and shallow subtidal taxa, causing instantaneous wasting prevalence rates of 5%-80%. Despite the collapse of some populations within weeks, environmental and species variation protracted the outbreak, which lasted 2-3 years from onset until declining to chronic background rates of similar to 2% sea star wasting prevalence. Recruitment began immediately in many species, and in general, sea star assemblages trended toward recovery; however, recovery was heterogeneous, and a marine heatwave in 2019 raised concerns of a second decline. The abiotic stressors most associated with the 2010s sea star wasting outbreak were elevated sea surface temperature and low wave exposure, as well as freshwater discharge in the north. However, detailed data speaking directly to the biological, ecological, and environmental cause(s) and consequences of the sea star wasting outbreak remain limited in scope, unavoidably retrospective, and perhaps always indeterminate. Redressing this shortfall for the future will require a broad spectrum of monitoring studies not less than the taxonomically broad cross-scale framework we have modeled in this synthesis.",2023,,BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN,244,3,143-163,WOS:001128914100001,10.1086/727969,,#701,Dawson 2023,"",heatwave
El Nino-Related Thermal Stress Coupled With Upwelling-Related Ocean Acidification Negatively Impacts Cellular to Population-Level Responses in Pteropods Along the California Current System With Implications for Increased Bioenergetic Costs,"Bednarsek, N; Feely, RA; Beck, MW; Glippa, O; Kanerva, M; Engström-Öst, J","Understanding the interactive effects of multiple stressors on pelagic mollusks associated with global climate change is especially important in highly productive coastal ecosystems of the upwelling regime, such as the California Current System (CCS). Due to temporal overlap between a marine heatwave, an El Nino event, and springtime intensification of the upwelling, pteropods of the CCS were exposed to co-occurring increased temperature, low Omega(ar) and pH, and deoxygenation. The variability in the natural gradients during NOAA's WCOA 2016 cruise provided a unique opportunity for synoptic study of chemical and biological interactions. We investigated the effects of in situ multiple drivers and their interactions across cellular, physiological, and population levels. Oxidative stress biomarkers were used to assess pteropods' cellular status and antioxidant defenses. Low aragonite saturation state (Omega(ar)) is associated with significant activation of oxidative stress biomarkers, as indicated by increased levels of lipid peroxidation (LPX), but the antioxidative activity defense might be insufficient against cellular stress. Thermal stress in combination with low Omega(ar) additively increases the level of LPX toxicity, while food availability can mediate the negative effect. On the physiological level, we found synergistic interaction between low Omega(ar) and deoxygenation and thermal stress (Omega(ar) :T, O-2:T). On the population level, temperature was the main driver of abundance distribution, with low Omega(ar) being a strong driver of secondary importance. The additive effects of thermal stress and low Omega(ar) on abundance suggest a negative effect of El Nino at the population level. Our study clearly demonstrates Omega(ar )and temperature are master variables in explaining biological responses, cautioning the use of a single parameter in the statistical analyses. High quantities of polyunsaturated fatty acids are susceptible to oxidative stress because of LPX, resulting in the loss of lipid reserves and structural damage to cell membranes, a potential mechanism explaining extreme pteropod sensitivity to low Omega(ar). Accumulation of oxidative damage requires metabolic compensation, implying energetic trade-offs under combined thermal and low Omega(ar) and pH stress. Oxidative stress biomarkers can be used as early-warning signal of multiple stressors on the cellular level, thereby providing important new insights into factors that set limits to species' tolerance to in situ multiple drivers.",2018,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,5,,,WOS:000457221300001,10.3389/fmars.2018.00486,,#707,Bednarsek 2018,"",acidity; compound event; ecosystem response; heatwave
"STATE OF THE CALIFORNIA CURRENT 2016-17: STILL ANYTHING BUT ""NORMAL"" IN THE NORTH","Wells, BK; Schroeder, ID; Bograd, SJ; Hazen, EL; Jacox, MG; Leising, A; Mantua, N; Santora, JA; Fisher, J; Peterson, WT; Bjorkstedt, E; Robertson, RR; Chavez, FP; Goericke, R; Kudela, R; Anderson, C; Lavaniegos, BE; Gomez-Valdes, J; Brodeur, RD; Daly, EA; Morgan, CA; Auth, TD; Field, JC; Sakuma, K; McClatchie, S; Thompson, AR; Weber, ED; Watson, W; Suryan, RM; Parrish, J; Dolliver, J; Loredo, S; Porquez, JM; Zamon, JE; Schneider, SR; Golightly, RT; Warzybok, P; Bradley, R; Jahncke, J; Sydeman, W; Melin, SR; Hildebrand, JA; Debich, AJ; Thayre, B","This report examines the ecosystem state of the California Current System (CCS) from spring 2016-spring 2017. Basin-scale indices suggest conditions that would support average to below average coast-wide production across the CCS during this time period. Regional surveys in 2016 sampled anomalously warm surface and subsurface waters across the CCS. Chlorophyll concentrations were low across the CCS in 2016 and, concomitant with that, copepod communities had an anomalously high abundance of subtropical species. Early in 2017 conditions between northern, central, and southern CCS were dissimilar. Specifically, surface conditions north of Cape Mendocino remained anomalously warm, chlorophyll was very low, and subtropical copepods were anomalously abundant. Southern and central CCS surveys indicated that environmental conditions and chlorophyll were within normal ranges for the longer time series, supporting an argument that biophysical conditions/ecosystem states in the southern and central CCS were close to normal.Epipelagic micronekton assemblages south of Cape Mendocino were generally close to longer-term average values, however the northern assemblages have not returned to a ""normal"" state following the 2014-15 large marine heatwave and 2016 El Nino. North of Cape Mendocino the epipelagic micronekton was largely composed of offshore and southern derived taxa. We hypothesize that stronger-than-typical winter downwelling in 2017 and a reduced spawning biomass of forage taxa are contributors to the anomalous forage community observed in the north. Also of note, surveys indicate northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) abundance was greater than average (for recent years) and nearer shore in northern regions. Finally, record-low juvenile coho and Chinook salmon catches in the 2017 northern CCS salmon survey suggest that out-migrating Columbia Basin salmon likely experienced unusually high early mortality at sea, and this is further supported by similarities between the 2017 forage assemblage and that observed during poor outmigration survival years in 2004, 2005, and 2015.Generally, the reproductive success of seabirds in 2016 (the most current year available) was low in the north but near average in central California. At Yaquina Head off Oregon and Castle Rock off northern California some of the lowest reproductive success rates on record were documented. In addition to reduced abundance of prey, there was a northward shift of preferred seabird prey. Seabird diets in northern areas also corroborated observations of a northward shift in fish communities. Nest failure was attributed to a combination of bottom-up and top-down forces. At Castle Rock, most chicks died of starvation whereas, at Yaquina Head, most nests failed (95% of common murre, Uria aagle) due to disturbance by bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) seeking alternative prey. Mean bird densities at sea for the 2017 surveys between Cape Flattery Washington and Newport Oregon were the lowest observed and may indicate continued poor reproductive performance of resident breeders in 2017. South of Cape Mendocino, where forage availability was typical, seabird reproductive success was also below average for most species in 2016, but did not approach failure rates observed in the north. Finally, in 2017, abundances of seabirds observed at-sea off southern California were anomalously high suggesting an improved foraging environment in that area.Marine mammal condition and foraging behavior were also impacted by the increased abundance and shifting distribution of the northern anchovy population. Increases in the abundance of northern anchovy in the Southern California Bight coincided with improved condition of sea lion (Zalophus californianus) pups in 2016. Namely, lipid-rich northern anchovy occurred in great frequencies in the nursing female diet. Increases in northern anchovy nearshore in the central and northern CCS may have also contributed to a shoreward shift in distribution of humpback whales (Megaptera -novaeangliae) in these regions. These shifts along with recovering humpback whale populations contributed to recent increases in human-whale interactions (e.g., fixed-gear entanglements).",2017,,CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS,58,,1-55,WOS:000418377800001,,,#726,Wells 2017,"",ecosystem response
Disassembly of an epibenthic assemblage in a sustained severely hypoxic event in a northeast Pacific basin,"Gasbarro, R; Chu, JWF; Tunnicliffe, V","As global ocean deoxygenation proceeds and the frequency of extreme low-oxygen (hypoxic) events increases, seafloor ecosystems will inevitably be affected. Our study examines how benthic community responses scale with the severity and spatial extent of hypoxia. Saanich Inlet is a natural model system for testing the effects of hypoxic conditions that determine the benthic megafaunal community structure during annual deoxygenation and reoxygenation. In 2016, an anomalously severe and widespread hypoxic event occurred in the fjord after a decade of oxygen decline at a rate of 0.07 mL L-1 y(-1) as measured by a cabled seafloor observatory. We use a living ecological time-series generated from remotely operated vehicle surveys to assess how the benthic megafaunal community disassembled in response to this extreme hypoxic event. Three benthic surveys at similar times in 2013 and 2016 reveal large increases in the area of seafloor bathed in anoxic and hypoxic waters in the latter year. Both bottom oxygen and species depth distributions shoaled from 2013 to 2016, accompanied by a 56% overall decline in megafauna. The abundant habitat-forming pennatulacean octocoral, Halipteris willemoesi, decreased in abundance by 92.3% from fall 2013 to fall 2016, and pandalid shrimp disappeared from the community. Hypoxia-tolerant species experienced milder losses, and two new species occurred in 2016-one a predator on the coral. Co-occurrence analyses revealed loss of significant community segregation from 2013 to 2016, and a re-mix of pairwise species co-occurrences in the latter year. The loss of oxygenated habitat compressed species into narrower depth ranges and led to disassembly probably through niche space constriction, while decimation of some populations eliminated key community associations. Community fragmentation and disruption of interactions is a possible outcome for many marine benthic ecosystems as marine hypoxia intensifies.",2019,,JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS,198,,,WOS:000477916900001,10.1016/j.jmarsys.2019.103184,,#898,Gasbarro 2019,"",deoxygenation; ecosystem response
Larval Fish Habitats and Deoxygenation in the Northern Limit of the Oxygen Minimum Zone off Mexico,"Sánchez-Velasco, L; Godínez, VM; Ruvalcaba-Aroche, ED; Márquez-Artavia, A; Beier, E; Barton, ED; Jiménez-Rosenberg, SPA","The present state of deoxygenation in the northern limits of the shallow oxygen minimum zone off Mexico is examined in order to detect its effects on larval fish habitats and consider the sensitivity of fish larvae to decreased dissolved oxygen. A series of cruises between 2000 and 2017 indicated a significant vertical expansion of low oxygen waters. The upper limit of suboxic conditions (<4.4 mu mol/kg) has risen similar to 100 m at 19.5 degrees N off Cabo Corrientes and similar to 50 m at 25 degrees N in the mouth of the Gulf of California. The larval habitat distribution was related to the geographic variability of dissolved oxygen and water masses between these two latitudes. One recurrent larval habitat, with Bregmaceros bathymaster larvae as the indicator species, extended throughout the water column off Cabo Corrientes from Subtropical Subsurface Water (suboxic conditions) to the surface (220 mu mol/kg). The second recurrent habitat was located between the oxycline (>44 mu mol/kg) and the surface in association with the Gulf of California Water, with Benthosema panamense as the indicator species. During the warm El Nino event of 2015-2016, a tropical larval fish habitat (Auxis spp.) associated with Tropical Surface Water appeared to change the larval habitat distributions. These results indicate that some species are resilient to changes of dissolved oxygen and temperature generated by El Nino events and by continuing deoxygenation, although other species with more limited environmental windows could be affected by deoxygenation, probably leading to a change of the pelagic ecosystem over time.Plain Language Summary Dissolved oxygen in the ocean is crucial for the biological cycles of all organisms. There are vast zones in the ocean where the oxygen has dropped to levels that only a few, very well adapted, organisms can live. Dissolved oxygen measurements in the past two decades in the Mexican Pacific have shown that the concentrations have decreased, and water layers with nearly no oxygen are now closer to the surface, potentially impacting larval fish species that are not adapted to extremely low oxygen concentrations. Nevertheless, there is a set of fish larvae that is well adapted to low dissolved oxygen concentrations, principally small forage fish, which have a permanent presence in the poorly oxygenated waters, while some larvae of species with fisheries interest, like small tunids, only live in the well-oxygenated surface layer and are more abundant in warm years. The loss of oxygen in the Mexican Pacific has not had an effect on the small forage fish larvae but can affect those larvae of fish of commercial interest, with less adaptation to low oxygen concentrations.",2019,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,124,12,9690-9705,WOS:000504779200001,10.1029/2019JC015414,,#925,Sánchez-Velasco 2019,"Helen Killeen (2025-10-23 08:31:42)(Select): including because the elnino event in question was part of the ""Blobino"" event; Helen Killeen (2025-05-02 02:46:41)(Screen): Gulf of CA; ",deoxygenation; ecosystem response; physical drivers
Impact of the transboundary Razdolnaya and Tumannaya Rivers on deoxygenation of the Peter the Great Bay (Sea of Japan),"Tishchenko, PY; Tishchenko, PP; Lobanov, VB; Mikhaylik, TA; Sergeev, AF; Semkin, PY; Shvetsova, MG","It has been established that the waters of the transboundary Razdolnaya (Suifen) and Tumannaya (Tumen) Rivers are highly polluted by nutrients. Loads of nutrients supplied by the Razdolnaya and Tumannaya Rivers cause eutrophication and induce seasonal hypoxia in areas off the river mouths in the Amursky Bay (northwestern part of Peter the Great bay (PGB)) and the Far Eastern Marine Biosphere Reserve (FEMBR) area (southwestern part of PGB). In both cases, hypoxia developed in the bottom waters in topographic depressions in the basins after the peak nutrient fluxes that occur in summer due to the monsoon climate. In 2013, anoxia occurred in the FEMBR area as a result of unusually heavy atmospheric precipitation at the end of July. The hypoxic areas expanded over approximately 60 km(2) and 17 km(2) in Amursky Bay and the FEMBR area, respectively. The hypoxia durations were approximately three months in 2011 in the semi-enclosed Amursky Bay and three weeks in 2014 in the more open FEMBR area. The observed hydrochemical anomalies (oxygen, phosphorus, silica, pH, DIC, ammonium) suggest that the main cause of hypoxia is degradation of ""excess"" diatoms on the water/sediment interface under dynamic water limitation. Mooring observations by a water quality monitoring station registered very high chlorophyll concentrations (approximately 50 mg/m(3)) in the bottom waters of the FEMBR area. These high chlorophyll concentrations may be attributed to the topographic depression, which works as a sediment trap and accumulates organic matter. Sharply increasing of transparency of water column in the FEMBR area caused by replacement of coastal waters on the waters of open sea can to develop periphyton on seafloor. There is synchronization in deoxygenation of regional water basins (in our case it is the shelf and open part of the Sea of Japan) and global basins (oceans) which may be caused by variations in the chemical composition of atmosphere.",2020,,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,239,,,WOS:000531077000008,10.1016/j.ecss.2020.106731,,#985,Tishchenko 2020,"KAREN HUNTER (2025-09-10 06:53:18)(Select): Refers to an anomalous deoxygenation event in an area that has regular seasonal deoygenation.

Drivers and Potential Consequences of Observed Extreme Hypoxia Along the Canadian Pacific Continental Shelf,"Franco, AC; Ianson, D; Ross, T; Hannah, C; Sastri, A; Tortell, PD","Bottom waters of the northeast Pacific continental shelf naturally experience localized hypoxic conditions, with significant influences on food webs and biogeochemical cycling. In August 2021, extreme hypoxia was detected from several measurement platforms along the southern British Columbia continental shelf, with oxygen concentration <60 mu mol kg(-1), and a difference from the seasonal climatology of more than 2 standard deviations. Early and intense remote upwelling and local density shifts were associated with an anomalously strong spring phytoplankton bloom, which likely stimulated localized respiration of subsurface organic matter. This event was concurrent with unsuitable habitat for Pacific halibut and calcite and aragonite undersaturation throughout most of the water column.

Strong Habitat Compression by Extreme Shoaling Events of Hypoxic Waters in the Eastern Pacific,"Kohn, EE; Munnich, M; Vogt, M; Desmet, F; Gruber, N","Ocean deoxygenation has led to a measurable shoaling of subsurface hypoxic waters ([O-2] < 60 mmol m(-3)) in the tropical Pacific and elsewhere. This shoaling compresses the vertical habitat of heterotrophic organisms between the well oxygenated surface and the hypoxic interface. Superimposed on this long-term trend, natural variability can cause shorter-term, extreme habitat compression events, which we term Transient Habitat Reduction Extreme Events (THREEs). Here, we investigate THREEs in the Eastern Pacific (EP) between 1979 and 2016 using output from a high-resolution hindcast simulation with the coupled physical-biogeochemical ocean model ROMS-BEC. We identify THREEs on the basis of the hypoxic interface being shallower than the 99th percentile of its variability and requiring a minimum duration of five days. We find that THREEs compress the aerobic habitat by up to 50%-70% (locally exceeding 80%) in the subtropical and tropical EP and reach horizontal scales exceeding 300 km in the tropical EP. There, THREEs are pre-conditioned by La Nina conditions and occur primarily in boreal winter and spring. In the subtropical EP, THREEs are associated with mesoscale eddies and occur independently of the season. 71% (32%) of all THREEs are characterized by unusually high acidity (cold) conditions (i.e., below the first percentile), thus constituting compound events. The strong habitat compression during THREEs is bound to lead to substantial changes in water column biogeochemistry, in food-web interactions, and in ecosystem structure. Yet, so far, very little is known about the impact of these transient phenomena.",2022,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,127,6,,WOS:000811932500001,10.1029/2022JC018429,,#1093,Kohn 2022,"KAREN HUNTER (2025-08-22 07:01:46)(Select): Believe this paper to be really important for us re: oxygen.

Anthropogenic and Climatic Contributions to Observed Carbon System Trends in the Northeast Pacific,"Franco, AC; Ianson, D; Ross, T; Hamme, RC; Monahan, AH; Christian, JR; Davelaar, M; Johnson, WK; Miller, LA; Robert, M; Tortell, PD","The ocean absorbs anthropogenic carbon, slowing atmospheric CO2 increase but driving ocean acidification. Long-term changes in the carbon system are typically assessed from single-point time series or from hydrographic sections spaced by decades. Using higher resolution observations (1-3 year(-1)) from the Line P time series, we investigate processes modulating trends in the carbon system of the northeast subarctic Pacific. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) from 1990 to 2019 reveal substantial trends over most of the upper water column along the 1,500 km coastal to open ocean transect. At the surface, an increasing trend in salinity-normalized DIC (sDIC(33)) (+0.5 +/- 0.4 mu mol kg(-1) yr(-1)) is associated with a decrease in pH (0.01-0.02 decade(-1)) and a decrease in aragonite saturation state (0.04-0.08 decade(-1)). These observed trends are driven by anthropogenic CO2 uptake, partially offset by trends in surface salinity or temperature. Stratification associated with recent marine heat waves appears to have caused anomalously low surface pCO(2). sDIC(33) trends of similar magnitude were found below the seasonal thermocline on the 26.7-26.8 isopycnals (150-300 m), which are ventilated in the western Pacific. Roughly, a third (20%-50%) of the subsurface sDIC(33) trend is driven by increased remineralization, likely caused by long-term decreases in ventilation in the western Pacific. Bidecadal oscillations in the ventilation of the 26.7-26.8 isopycnals arising from the Lunar Nodal Cycle cause oscillations in sDIC(33) and AOU at the offshore end of our transect.

East Asian monsoon and Pacific basin dynamics jointly regulate boreal winter marine cold spells in the Taiwan Strait,"Lian, Z; Yang, T; Leung, JCH; Zhang, BL","Marine cold spells (MCSs), characterized by pronounced seawater temperature declines, are representative marine responses to atmospheric and climatic extremes. Notably, during the boreal winter, MCSs in the Taiwan Strait (TS) have caused substantial economic losses due to the concurrence of juvenile development stages in mariculture and labor shortages during China's New Year vacation. Understanding the spatio-temporal features of MCSs and the underlying mechanisms is imperative for mitigating the associated economic detriments. This study, for the first time, delineates two MCS hotspots in the northeastern and western TS, based on various sea surface temperature datasets. Our findings reveal a notable frequency and intensity of MCSs in the 1980s, followed by a period of suppressed phase, reaching a historic low point in 2002.

Dissimilar Sensitivities of Ocean Acidification Metrics to Anthropogenic Carbon Accumulation in the Central North Pacific Ocean and California Current Large Marine Ecosystem,"Arroyo, MC; Fassbender, AJ; Carter, BR; Edwards, CA; Fiechter, J; Norgaard, A; Feely, RA","We analyze and compare changes in ocean acidification metrics caused by anthropogenic carbon (C-anth) accumulation in the North Pacific Ocean and California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME). The greatest declines in pH and carbonate mineral saturation state occur near the surface, coincident with the highest C-anth concentrations. However, maximal increases in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and hydrogen ion concentration occur subsurface where C-anth values are lower. We attribute dissimilar sensitivities of these metrics to background ocean chemistry, which has naturally high pCO(2) and low buffering capacity in subsurface waters due to accumulated byproducts of organic matter respiration, which interacts with C-anth. In the CCLME, rising subsurface pCO(2) has increased the frequency, duration, and intensity of hypercapnia (pCO(2) >= 1,000 mu atm) on the continental shelf. Our findings suggest that hypercapnia induced by C-anth accumulation can co-occur with hypoxia in the CCLME and is an additional modern stressor for marine organisms.",2022,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,49,15,,WOS:000842395500001,10.1029/2022GL097835,,#1417,Arroyo 2022,Helen Killeen (2025-07-23 04:04:27)(Select): hypercapnia focus ; ,acidity; indicators; physical drivers
Severe biological effects under present-day estuarine acidification in the seasonally variable Salish Sea,"Bednarsek, N; Newton, JA; Beck, MW; Alin, SR; Feely, RA; Christman, NR; Klinger, T","Estuaries are recognized as one of the habitats most vulnerable to coastal ocean acidification due to seasonal extremes and prolonged duration of acidified conditions. This is combined with co-occurring environmental stressors such as increased temperature and low dissolved oxygen. Despite this, evidence of biological impacts of ocean acidification in estuarine habitats is largely lacking. By combining physical, biogeochemical, and biological time-series observations over relevant seasonal-to-interannual time scales, this study is the first to describe both the spatial and temporal variation of biological response in the pteropod Limacina helicina to estuarine acidification in association with other stressors. Using clustering and principal component analyses, sampling sites were grouped according to their distribution of physical and biogeochemical variables over space and time. This identified the most exposed habitats and time intervals corresponding to themost severe negative biological impacts across three seasons and three years. We developed a cumulative stress index as a means of integrating spatial-temporal OA variation over the organismal life history. Our findings showthat over the 2014-2016 study period, the severity of low aragonite saturation state combined with the duration of exposure contributed to overall cumulative stress and resulted in severe shell dissolution. Seasonally-variable estuaries such as the Salish Sea (Washington, U.S.A.) predispose sensitive organisms tomore severe acidified conditions than those of coastal and open-ocean habitats, yet the sensitive organisms persist. We suggest potential environmental factors and compensatory mechanisms that allow pelagic calcifiers to inhabit less favorable habitats and partially offset associated stressors, for instance through food supply, increased temperature, and adaptation of their life history. The novel metric of cumulative stress developed here can be applied to other estuarine environments with similar physical and chemical dynamics, providing a new tool for monitoring biological response in estuaries under pressure from accelerating global change.

Through a novel coastal OA observing network, we have uncovered a remarkably persistent spatial mosaic in the penetration of acidified waters into ecologically-important nearshore habitats across 1,000 km of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. In the most severe exposure hotspots, suboptimal conditions for calcifying organisms encompassed up to 56% of the summer season, and were accompanied by some of the lowest and most variable pH environments known for the surface ocean.

"Effects of ocean acidification on the growth, photosynthetic performance, and domoic acid production of the diatom <i>Pseudo</i>-<i>nitzschia australis</i> from the California Current System","Wingert, CJ; Cochlan, WP","Pseudo-nitzschia australis (Frenguelli), a toxigenic pennate diatom capable of producing the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA), was examined in unialgal laboratory cultures to quantify its physiological response to ocean acidification (OA) - the decline in pH resulting from increasing partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in the oceans. Toxic blooms of P. australis are common in the coastal waters of eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUS), including those of the California Current System (CC S) off the west coast of the United States where increased pCO(2) and decreased seawater pH are well-known. This study determined the production of dissolved (dDA) and particulate DA (pDA), the rates of growth and nutrient (nitrate, silicate and phosphate) utilization, cellular elemental ratios of carbon and nitrogen, and the photosynthetic response to declining pH during the exponential and stationary growth phases of a strain of P. australis isolated during a massive toxic bloom that persisted for months along much of the U.S. west coast during 2015. Our controlled lab studies showed that DA production significantly increased as pCO(2) increased, and total DA (pDA + dDA) normalized to cell density was 2.7 fold greater at pH 7.8 compared to pH 8.1 (control) during nutrient-limited stationary growth. However, exponential growth rates did not increase with declining pH, but remained constant until pH of 7.8 was reached, and then specific growth rates declined by ca. 30%. The toxin results demonstrate that despite minimal effects of OA observed during the nutrient-replete exponential growth phase, the enhancement of DA production, notably the 3-fold increase in particulate DA per cell, with declining pH from 8.1 to 7.8 during the nutrient-depleted stationary phase, supports the hypothesis that increasing pCO(2) will result in greater toxic risk to coastal ecosystems from elevated ambient concentrations of particulate DA. The ecological consequences of decreasing silicate uptake rates and increasing cellular carbon quotas with declining pH may potentially ameliorate some negative impacts of OA on Pseudo-nitzschia growth in natural systems.",2021,,HARMFUL ALGAE,107,,,WOS:000691548100006,10.1016/j.hal.2021.102030,,#1448,Wingert 2021,"Rob Suryan (2025-10-17 06:05:30)(Select): Lab study, but impetus is extreme event and identifying mechanisms.

Modulation of ocean acidification by decadal climate variability in the Gulf of Alaska,"Hauri, C; Pagès, R; McDonnell, AMP; Stuecker, MF; Danielson, SL; Hedstrom, K; Irving, B; Schultz, C; Doney, SC","Uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by the surface ocean is leading to global ocean acidification, but regional variations in ocean circulation and mixing can dampen or accelerate apparent acidification rates. Here we use a regional ocean model simulation for the years 1980 to 2013 and observational data to investigate how ocean fluctuations impact acidification rates in surface waters of the Gulf of Alaska. We find that large-scale atmospheric forcing influenced local winds and upwelling strength, which in turn affected ocean acidification rate. Specifically, variability in local wind stress curl depressed sea surface height in the subpolar gyre over decade-long intervals, which increased upwelling of nitrate- and dissolved inorganic carbon-rich waters and enhanced apparent ocean acidification rates. We define this sea surface height variability as the Northern Gulf of Alaska Oscillation and suggest that it can cause extreme acidification events that are detrimental to ecosystem health and fisheries.Decadal wind patterns enhance upwelling of carbon-rich waters and increase apparent surface ocean acidification rates in the Gulf of Alaska, according to a 34-year regional ocean biogeochemical hindcast model simulation.",2021,,COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,2,1,,WOS:000696223300001,10.1038/s43247-021-00254-z,,#1506,Hauri 2021,"",acidity; indicators; physical drivers
Tracking the Space-Time Evolution of Ocean Acidification Extremes in the California Current System and Northeast Pacific,"Desmet, F; Gruber, N; Köhn, EE; Münnich, M; Vogt, M","Ocean acidification is punctuated by episodic extremes of low pH and saturation state with regard to aragonite (omega(A)). Here, we use a hindcast simulation from 1984 to 2019 with a high-resolution regional ocean model (ROMS-BEC) to identify and track ocean acidification extremes (OAX) in the northeast Pacific and the California current system (CCS). In the first step, we identify all grid-cells whose pH and omega(A) are simultaneously below their first percentile over the analysis period (1984-2019). In the second step, we aggregate all neighboring cells with extreme conditions into three-dimensional time evolving events, permitting us to track them in a Lagrangian manner over their lifetime. We detect more than 22 thousand events that occur at least once in the upper 100 m during their lifetime, with broad distributions in terms of size, duration, volume, and intensity, and with 26% of them harboring corrosive conditions (omega(A) < 1). By clustering the OAXs, we find three types of extremes in the CCS. Near the coast, intense, shallow, and short-lasting OAXs dominate, caused by strong upwelling. A second type consists of large and long-lasting OAX events that are associated with westward propagating cyclonic eddies. They account for only 3% of all extremes, but are the most severe events. The third type is small extremes at depth arising from pycnocline heave. OAXs potentially have deleterious effects on marine life. Marine calcifiers, such as pteropods, might be especially impacted by the long-lasting events with corrosive conditions.",2022,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,127,5,,WOS:000795869500001,10.1029/2021JC018159,,#1551,Desmet 2022,"",acidity; physical impact

Here, we quantified remotely sensed maximum heat stress during the 2014-2017 bleaching event, census-based net carbonate budgets from benthic imagery and fish survey data, and net reef calcification from salinity normalized seawater total alkalinity anomalies collected from 2017-2019 for 56 Pacific coral reef sites (Mariana Islands, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Pacific Remote Island Areas, and American Samoa). We incorporated the census-based and chemistry-based metrics to determine a calcification vulnerability index for each site to maintain calcium carbonate balance to provide accessible information to managers and policy makers. Most coral reef sites likely experienced ecologically severe (79%, n = 44) or significant (9%, n = 7) heat stress during the 2014-2017 coral bleaching event. Census-based net carbonate budgets (mean +/- 95% = 2.1 +/- 0.6 kg CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1)) were positive for 77% of sites (n = 43), neutral for 16% of sites (n = 9), and negative for 7% of sites (n = 4). Chemistry-based relative net reef calcification (mean +/- 95% = 22 +/- 10 mu mol kg(-1)) was positive for 84% of sites (n = 47), neutral for 11% of sites (n = 6), and negative for 5% of sites (n = 3). The calcification vulnerability index suggested the Pacific Ocean reef sites surveyed were of minimal (68%, n = 38) to moderate (32%, n = 18) concern for maintaining calcium carbonate balance following the bleaching event.

Reconstructing Aragonite Saturation State Based on an Empirical Relationship for Northern California,"Davis, CV; Hewett, K; Hill, TM; Largier, JL; Gaylord, B; Jahncke, J","Ocean acidification is a global phenomenon with highly regional spatial and temporal patterns. In order to address the challenges of future ocean acidification at a regional scale, it is necessary to increase the resolution of spatial and temporal monitoring of the inorganic carbon system beyond what is currently available. One approach is to develop empirical regional models that enable aragonite saturation state to be estimated from existing hydrographic measurements, for which greater spatial coverage and longer time series exist in addition to higher spatial and temporal resolution. We present such a relationship for aragonite saturation state for waters off Northern California based on in situ bottle sampling and instrumental measurements of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. Application of this relationship to existing datasets (5 to 200 m depth) demonstrates both seasonal and interannual variability in aragonite saturation state. We document a deeper aragonite saturation horizon and higher near surface aragonite saturation state in the summers of 2014 and 2015 (compared with 2010-2013), associated with anomalous warm conditions and decadal scale oscillations. Application of this model to time series data reiterates the direct association between low aragonite saturation state and upwelled waters and highlights the extent to which benthic communities on the Northern California shelf are already exposed to aragonite undersaturated waters.",2018,,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,41,7,2056-2069,WOS:000445240600014,10.1007/s12237-018-0372-0,,#1625,Davis 2018,"",acidity; heatwave
Narratives Can Motivate Environmental Action: The Whiskey Creek Ocean Acidification Story,"Kelly, RP; Cooley, SR; Klinger, T","Even when environmental data quantify the risks and benefits of delayed responses to rapid anthropogenic change, institutions rarely respond promptly. We propose that narratives complementing environmental datasets can motivate responsive environmental policy. To explore this idea, we relate a case study in which a narrative of economic loss due to regionally rapid ocean acidification-an anthropogenic change-helped connect knowledge with action. We pose three hypotheses to explain why narratives might be particularly effective in linking science to environmental policy, drawing from the literature of economics, environmental policy, and cognitive psychology. It seems that yet-untold narratives may hold similar potential for strengthening the feedback between environmental data and policy and motivating regional responses to other environmental problems.",2014,,AMBIO,43,5,592-599,WOS:000340591400004,10.1007/s13280-013-0442-2,,#1655,Kelly 2014,"",acidity

While perturbation studies, in the form of incubations under elevated pCO(2), reveal sensitivities and responses of individual species, one missing link in the OA story results from a chronic lack of pH data specific to a given species' natural habitat. Here, we present a compilation of continuous, high-resolution time series of upper ocean pH, collected using autonomous sensors, over a variety of ecosystems ranging from polar to tropical, open-ocean to coastal, kelp forest to coral reef. These observations reveal a continuum of month-long pH variability with standard deviations from 0.004 to 0.277 and ranges spanning 0.024 to 1.430 pH units. The nature of the observed variability was also highly site-dependent, with characteristic diel, semi-diurnal, and stochastic patterns of varying amplitudes. These biome-specific pH signatures disclose current levels of exposure to both high and low dissolved CO2, often demonstrating that resident organisms are already experiencing pH regimes that are not predicted until 2100. Our data provide a first step toward crystallizing the biophysical link between environmental history of pH exposure and physiological resilience of marine organisms to fluctuations in seawater CO2. Knowledge of this spatial and temporal variation in seawater chemistry allows us to improve the design of OA experiments: we can test organisms with a priori expectations of their tolerance guardrails, based on their natural range of exposure. Such hypothesis-testing will provide a deeper understanding of the effects of OA. Both intuitively simple to understand and powerfully informative, these and similar comparative time series can help guide management efforts to identify areas of marine habitat that can serve as refugia to acidification as well as areas that are particularly vulnerable to future ocean change.",2011,,PLOS ONE,6,12,,WOS:000298665600019,10.1371/journal.pone.0028983,,#1724,Hofmann 2011,"",GLOBAL; acidity; ecosystem response; physical drivers

These rates of decrease are faster than those caused by increasing atmospheric CO2 and faster than those observed during previous research.

Upwelling intensity and source water properties drive high interannual variability of corrosive events in the California Current,"Cheresh, J; Kroeker, KJ; Fiechter, J","Ocean acidification is progressing rapidly in the California Current System (CCS), a region already susceptible to reduced aragonite saturation state due to seasonal coastal upwelling. Results from a high-resolution (similar to 3 km), coupled physical-biogeochemical model highlight that the intensity, duration, and severity of undersaturation events exhibit high interannual variability along the central CCS shelfbreak. Variability in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) along the bottom of the 100-m isobath explains 70-90% of event severity variance over the range of latitudes where most severe conditions occur. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis further reveals that interannual event variability is explained by a combination coastal upwelling intensity and DIC content in upwelled source waters. Simulated regional DIC exhibits low frequency temporal variability resembling that of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and is explained by changes to water mass composition in the CCS. While regional DIC concentrations and upwelling intensity individually explain 9 and 43% of year-to-year variability in undersaturation event severity, their combined influence accounts for 66% of the variance.

The array of CO2 observing activities included high-resolution CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) and pHT (total scale) measurements made at the Hakai Institute's Quadra Island Field Station (QIFS) and from an Environment Canada weather buoy, respectively, as well as discrete seawater measurements of pCO(2) and total dissolved inorganic carbon (TCO2) obtained during a number of field campaigns. A relationship between NSS alkalinity and salinity was developed with the discrete datasets and used with the continuous measurements to highly resolve the marine CO2 system. Collectively, these datasets provided insights into the seasonality in this historically under-sampled region and detail the area's tendency for aragonite saturation state (Omega(arag)) to be at non-corrosive levels (i.e., Omega(arag) > 1) only in the upper water column during spring and summer months. This depth zone and time period of reprieve can be periodically interrupted by strong northwesterly winds that drive shortlived (similar to 1 week) episodes of high-pCO(2), low-pH, and low-Omega(arag) conditions throughout the region. Interannual variability in summertime conditions was evident and linked to reduced northwesterly winds and increased stratification. Anthropogenic CO2 in NSS surface water was estimated using data from 2017 combined with the global atmospheric CO2 forcing for the period 1765 to 2100, and projected a mean value of 49 +/- 5 mmol kg(-1) for 2018. The estimated trend in anthropogenic CO2 was further used to assess the evolution of Omega(arag) and pH(T) levels in NSS surface water, and revealed that wintertime corrosive Omega(arag) conditions were likely absent pre-1900. The percent of the year spent above Omega(arag) = 1 has dropped from similar to 98% in 1900 to similar to 60% by 2018.

Decadal changes in the CaCO<sub>3</sub> saturation state along 179°E in the Pacific Ocean,"Murata, A; Saito, S","To assess degrees of ocean acidification, we mainly investigated decadal changes in the saturation state of sea-water with respect to aragonite (Omega(arg)), which is a more vulnerable mineral form of CaCO3, along the 179 degrees E meridian (WOCE P14N) in the Pacific Ocean. We found a maximum decrease of Omega(arg) of -0.48 (-0.034 a(-1)) at 200-300 dbar (isopycnal surfaces of 24.0-25.8 kg m(-3)) at 20 degrees N. Between 1993 and 2007, the saturation horizon rose by 17 dbar (1.2 dbar a(-1)) at latitudes 10 degrees N-50 degrees N. Although Delta Omega(arg) mostly reflected changes in normalized dissolved inorganic carbon (Delta nC(T)), it was larger than could be explained by anthropogenic CO2 storage alone. Decomposition of Delta nC(T) revealed that Delta Omega(arg) was enhanced by approximately 50% by a non-anthropogenic CO2 contribution represented by changes in apparent oxygen utilization.

Nitrate and Chl-a fluorescence were <1 mu M and <1 Standardized Fluorescence Unit, respectively, at CCE2 for the entire durations of the Warm Anomaly and El Nino, the two longest periods of such low values in our time series. Negative nitrate and Chl-a anomalies at CCE2 were interrupted briefly by upwelling conditions in spring 2015. Near-surface temperature anomalies appeared simultaneously at both moorings in spring 2014, indicating region-wide onset of Warm Anomaly temperatures, although sustained negative nitrate and Chl-a anomalies only occurred offshore at CCE1 during El Nino (summer 2015 to spring 2016). Warm Anomaly temperature changes were expressed more strongly in near-surface (<40 m) than subsurface (75 m) waters at both moorings, while El Nino produced comparable temperature anomalies at near-surface and subsurface depths. Nearshore omega(aragonite) at 76 m showed notably fewer undersaturation events during both warm periods, suggesting an environment more conducive to calcifying organisms. Planktonic calcifying molluscs (pteropods and heteropods) increased markedly in springs 2014 and 2016 and remained modestly elevated in spring 2015.

Starting in late 2013, elevated seawater pCO(2) values driven by warm anomalies cause this region to be a net annual CO2 source for the first time in the observational record, demonstrating how climate forcing can influence the timing of an ocean region shift from CO2 sink to source.",2017,,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,44,11,5627-5636,WOS:000404382600043,10.1002/2017GL073814,,#2017,Sutton 2017,"Rob Suryan (2025-10-15 12:43:15)(Select): This is mostly about seasonal and long-term trends, but I included because it does mention an effect of the heatwave ""Anomalous North Pacific warming in 2013–2015 may be the first example of a climatic

Ventilation of the Upper Oxygen Minimum Zone in the Coastal Region Off Mexico: Implications of El Nino 2015-2016,"Trucco-Pignata, PN; Hernández-Ayón, JM; Santamaria-del-Angel, E; Beier, E; Sánchez-Velasco, L; Godínez, VM; Norzagaray, O","As a result of anthropogenic activities, it has been predicted that the ocean will be challenged with rising temperature, increased stratification, ocean acidification, stronger more frequent tropical storms, and oxygen depletion. In the tropical Pacific off central Mexico all these phenomena are already occurring naturally, providing a laboratory from which to explore ocean biogeochemical dynamics that are predicted under future anthropogenic forcing conditions. Here, seasonally anomalous surface tropical waters were detected as a result of the developing ""Godzilla El Nino 2015-2016."" The incursion of this oxygenated water modified the local structure of an intense and shallow oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), partially eroding and intensifying the oxycline while having an associated impact on the carbon maximum zone. The core of the OMZ (<4.4 mu mol kg(-1)) was centered around 474 m, with a variant upper level between 50 and 360 m depth. Below the dominance of Tropical Surface Waters, the thickness of the oxycline varied between 10 and 325 m, with intensity values up to 11 mu mol kg(-1) m(-1). The change in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and apparent oxygen utilization yielded a molar ratio of delta DIC = 0.98 x delta AOU during June 2015 and of delta DIC = 1.08 x delta AOU for March 2016. A further decrease in the average content of DIC was observed in the carbon maximum zone for 2016. Traditionally, different explanations have been proposed to account for changing oxygen concentrations in the ocean rather than considering the interactions between multiple forcing factors. Our results highlight the significance of an episodic event like El Nino in the distribution and concentration of O-2 and DIC and as a plausible mechanism of ventilation and increased oxygen availability in the upper OMZ of the tropical Pacific off central Mexico.",2019,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,6,,,WOS:000476942800001,10.3389/fmars.2019.00459,,#2213,Trucco-Pignata 2019,"Helen Killeen (2025-10-23 08:34:31)(Select): ""Godzilla El Nino"" event ~ Blob; ",deoxygenation; heatwave; physical impact
Widespread and increasing near-bottom hypoxia in the coastal ocean off the United States Pacific Northwest,"Barth, JA; Pierce, SD; Carter, BR; Chan, FC; Erofeev, AY; Fisher, JL; Feely, RA; Jacobson, KC; Keller, AA; Morgan, CA; Pohl, JE; Rasmuson, LK; Simon, V","The 2021 summer upwelling season off the United States Pacific Northwest coast was unusually strong leading to widespread near-bottom, low-oxygen waters. During summer 2021, an unprecedented number of ship- and underwater glider-based measurements of dissolved oxygen were made in this region. Near-bottom hypoxia, that is dissolved oxygen less than 61 mu mol kg-1 and harmful to marine animals, was observed over nearly half of the continental shelf inshore of the 200-m isobath, covering 15,500 square kilometers. A mid-shelf ribbon with near-bottom, dissolved oxygen less than 50 mu mol kg-1 extended for 450 km off north-central Oregon and Washington. Spatial patterns in near-bottom oxygen are related to the continental shelf width and other features of the region. Maps of near-bottom oxygen since 1950 show a consistent trend toward lower oxygen levels over time. The fraction of near-bottom water inshore of the 200-m isobath that is hypoxic on average during the summer upwelling season increases over time from nearly absent (2%) in 1950-1980, to 24% in 2009-2018, compared with 56% during the anomalously strong upwelling conditions in 2021.

Distribution of Atlantidae species (Gastropoda: Pterotracheoidea) during an El Nino event in the Southern California Current System (summer-fall 2015),"Aceves-Medina, G; Moreno-Alcántara, M; Durazo, R; Delgado-Hofmann, D","Atlantids are holoplanktonic gastropods present in tropical to sub-polar waters, and have gained an increasing interest due to their potential use as biological indicators of climate change and ocean acidification. However, there is a lack of information regarding their distribution for large areas of some oceans, particularly in the California Current System (CCS), which has been used as a model for many acidification studies and where intense warming events occur. The distribution patterns of 18 species of Atlantidae off the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, representing 90% of the atlantid species registered for the Pacific Ocean, were analyzed during a period of warm anomalies associated with the El Nino of 2015-2016 and the 2014-2016 marine heat wave (MHW). The species distribution showed 3 groups: 2 in the north (coastal and oceanic) and 1 in the south. The limit of distribution between these 3 groups was found in the vicinity of Punta Eugenia (PE). The southernmost community of atlantids was characterized by tropical and subtropical species that were transported northward due to coastal advection of warm waters associated with the El Nino of 2015-2016. North of PE, the warm-water affinity oceanic species Atlanta rosea and A. fragilis were found, evidencing the entrance of water from the Central Pacific related to MHW which affected the oceanic region off the coast of PE. The response of the distribution patterns proves that atlantids can be used as biological indicators, as they reflect the effect of environmental anomalies in the southern CCS.",2020,,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,648,,153-168,WOS:000621222200011,10.3354/meps13417,,#2290,Aceves-Medina 2020,"",acidity
Biogeochemical variability in the California Current System,"Deutsch, C; Frenzel, H; McWilliams, JC; Renault, L; Kessouri, F; Howard, E; Liang, JH; Bianchi, D; Yang, S","The biological productivity and diversity of the California Current System (CCS) is at the leading edge of major emerging climate trends, including hypoxia and acidification. We present results from a hindcast simulation (reanalysis) of an eddy-resolving oceanic physical-biogeochemical model of the CCS, to characterize its mean state and its patterns and drivers of variability in marine biogeochemical and ecosystem processes from 1995 to 2010. This is a companion paper to a physical analysis in Renault et al. (2021). The model reproduces long-term mean distributions of key ecosystem metrics, including surface nutrients and productivity and subsurface O2 and carbonate undersaturation. The spatial patterns of Net Primary Productivity (NPP) are broadly consistent with measured and remotely sensed rates, and they reflect a predominant limitation by nitrogen, with seasonal and episodic limitation by Fe nearshore in the central CCS, and in the open ocean northern CCS. The vertical distribution of NPP is governed by the trade-off between nutrient and light limitation, a balance that reproduces and explains the observed spatial variations in the depth of the deep Chl maximum. The seasonal to interannual variability of biogeochemical properties and rates is also well captured by model simulations. Because of the prevailing nutrient limitation, fluctuations in the depth of the pycnocline and associated nutricline are the leading single factor explaining interannual variability in the interior biogeochemical state, and the relationships between density and biogeochemical rates and tracers are consistent between model and observations. The magnitude and relationship between density structure and biogeochemical processes is illustrated by the 1997-98 El Nin tilde o event, which faithfully reproduces the single largest deviation from the mean state in the simulated period. A slower decadal shoaling of the pycnocline also accounts for the concomitant trends in hypoxic and corrosive conditions on the shelf. The resulting variability is key to understanding the vulnerability of marine species to oceanic change, and to the detection of such changes, soon projected to exceed the range of conditions in the past century.",2021,,PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY,196,,,WOS:000677549000003,10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102565,,#2464,Deutsch 2021,"Helen Killeen (2025-08-06 02:38:32)(Select): Event described here is mostly an ENSO event, some reference to general regional ""anomalies"" as well. ; ",ecosystem response; indicators; physical drivers
"Distribution and abundance of juvenile demersal fishes in relation to summer hypoxia and other environmental variables in coastal Oregon, USA","Sobocinski, KL; Ciannelli, L; Wakefield, WW; Yergey, ME; Johnson-Colegrove, A","The juvenile demersal fish assemblage along the Pacific Northwest coast has received little attention relative to adult life history stages since pioneering work in the 1970s. Increasing severity of hypoxia along the Oregon coast in recent years has prompted investigations into the response of biota in this region. We used summer data (2008-2013) from a beam trawl survey targeting juvenile demersal fishes in soft-bottom habitats along the Oregon coast to describe patterns of distribution and abundance at fixed sampling stations (from 30 m to 100 m depth). We relate the assemblage and abundance of the common species to environmental variables and analyze condition of recently settled fish (<50 mm SL). Most of the captured fishes were young-of-the-year flatfishes, dominated by Butter Sole (Isopsetta isolepis), English Sole (Parophrys vetulus), Speckled Sanddab (Citharichthys stigmaeus), and Pacific Sanddab (Citharichthys sordidus). Community analysis of the full dataset showed some variation in species richness among years and high evenness across all sampling sites and years. Depth was a structuring variable for the community, indicated by multivariate nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis. Generalized additive models for common flatfish species abundances during the summer months indicated depth preferences, with Butter Sole, English Sole, and Speckled Sanddab at shallower locations and Pacific Sanddab occurring at deeper locations farther offshore. Additionally, while most common species were collected in high abundances in hypoxic conditions, dissolved oxygen was a significant factor in determining flatfish abundance. Condition factor was weakly negatively impacted by low dissolved oxygen for the species assessed, but the strength of the relationship varied by species. Increased sampling frequency and spatial coverage would improve our understanding of this community, especially in light of changing environmental drivers such as decreasing pH, warming water, and episodic periods of low dissolved oxygen coinciding with settlement for many species.

A comparative appraisal of the resilience of marine social-ecological systems to mass mortalities of bivalves,"Guillotreau, P; Allison, EH; Bundy, A; Cooley, SR; Defeo, O; Le Bihan, V; Pardo, S; Perry, RI; Santopietro, G; Seki, T","In many parts of the world, both wild and cultured populations of bivalves have been struck by mass mortality episodes because of climatic and anthropogenic stressors whose causes and consequences are not always clearly understood. Such outbreaks have resulted in a range of responses from the social (fishers or farmers) and governing systems. We analyzed six commercial bivalve industries affected by mass mortalities using I-ADApT, a decision support framework to assess the impacts and consequences of these perturbations on the natural, social, and governing systems, and the consequent responses of stakeholders to these events. We propose a multidimensional resilience framework to assess resilience along the natural, social, and governing axes and to compare adaptive responses and their likelihood of success. The social capital and governability of the local communities were key factors affecting the communities' resilience and adaptation to environmental changes, but the rapid degradation of natural ecosystems puts the bivalve industry under a growing threat. Bivalve mariculture and fishing industries are likely to experience increased frequency, severity, and prevalence of such mass mortality events if the resilience of the natural systems is not improved. An understanding of previous adaptation processes can inform strategies for building adaptive capacity to future events.",2017,,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,22,1,,WOS:000399397700042,10.5751/ES-09084-220146,,#2813,Guillotreau 2017,Helen Killeen (2025-08-15 06:53:06)(Select): Puget Sound case study is PICES-relevant; ,GLOBAL; acidity; economic impact; social impact
