AB Marine organisms are under threat from a simultaneous combination of climate change stressors, including warming sea surface temperatures (SST), marine heatwave (MHW) episodes, and hypoxic events. This study sought to investigate the impacts of these stressors on the Australasian snapper (C. auratus) - a finfish species of high commercial and recreational importance, from the largest snapper fishery in Aotearoa New Zealand (SNA1). A MHW scenario was simulated from 21? (current February SST average for north-eastern New Zealand) to a future predicted level of 25?, with the whole-animal and mitochondrial metabolic performance of snapper in response to hypoxia and elevated temperature tested after 1-, 10-, and 30-days of thermal challenge. It was hypothesised that key indicators of snapper metabolic performance would decline after 1-day of MHW stress, but that partial recovery might arise as result of thermal plasticity after chronic (e.g., 30-day) exposures. In contrast to this hypothesis, snapper performance remained high throughout the MHW: 1) Aerobic metabolic scope increased after 1-day of 25? exposure and remained high. 2) Hypoxia tolerance, measured as the critical O-2 pressure and O-2 pressure where loss of equilibrium occurred, declined after 1-day of warm-acclimation, but recovered quickly with no observable difference from the 21? control following 30-days at 25?. 3) The performance of snapper mitochondria was also maintained, with oxidative phosphorylation respiration and proton leak flux across the inner mitochondrial membrane of the heart remaining mostly unaffected. Collectively, the results suggest that heart mitochondria displayed resilience, or plasticity, in snapper chronically exposed to 25?. Therefore, contrary to the notion of climate change having adverse metabolic effects, future temperatures approaching 25? may be tolerated by C. auratus in Northern New Zealand. Even in conjunction with supplementary hypoxia, 25? appears to represent a metabolically optimal temperature for this species.

TI Macrophage-mediated response to hypoxia in disease
SO HYPOXIA
LA English
DT Review
DE macrophage; hypoxia; inflammation; cytokine
AB Hypoxia plays a critical role in the pathobiology of various inflamed, diseased tissues, including malignant tumors, atherosclerotic plaques, myocardial infarcts, the synovia of rheumatoid arthritic joints, healing wounds, and sites of bacterial infection. These areas of hypoxia form when the blood supply is occluded and/ or the oxygen supply is unable to keep pace with cell growth and/ or infiltration of inflammatory cells. Macrophages are ubiquitous in all tissues of the body and exhibit great plasticity, allowing them to perform divergent functions, including, among others, patrolling tissue, combating invading pathogens and tumor cells, orchestrating wound healing, and restoring homeostasis after an inflammatory response. The number of tissue macrophages increases markedly with the onset and progression of many pathological states, with many macrophages accumulating in avascular and necrotic areas, where they are exposed to hypoxia. Recent studies show that these highly versatile cells then respond rapidly to the hypoxia present by altering their expression of a wide array of genes. Here we review the evidence for hypoxia-driven macrophage inflammatory responses in various disease states, and how this influences disease progression and treatment.

AB Massive bodies of low-oxygen bottom waters are found in coastal areas worldwide, which are detrimental to coastal ecosystems. In summer 2020, the response of coastal hypoxia to extreme weather events, including a catastrophic flooding, an extreme marine heatwave, and Typhoon Bavi, is investigated based on multiple satellite, four cruises, and mooring observations. The extensive fan-shaped hypoxia zone presents significant northward extension during July-September 2020, and is estimated as large as 13 000 km2 with rather low oxygen minimum (0.42 mg/L) during its peak in 28-30 August. This severe hypoxia is attributed to the persistent strong stratification, which is indicated by flood-induced larger amount of riverine freshwater input and subsequent marine heatwave off the Changjiang River Estuary. Moreover, the Typhoon Bavi has limited effect on the marine heatwave and coastal hypoxia in summer 2020.

AB Warming of coastal regions due to climate change is exerting chronic thermal stress on intertidal organisms, many of which are already living at or near their limits for thermal tolerance. In addition, increasing frequency of marine heat waves and algal blooms leading to hypoxic events in estuaries exert acute stresses on aerobic organisms. Hypoxia and warming rarely occur in isolation, and when combined, likely have synergistic detrimental effects on bivalves. Further, midday low tides have been identified as important drivers of mass mortality events for bivalves as a consequence of the combined effects of thermal stress and desiccation. Accordingly, the current study focuses on the sublethal and lethal effects of these combined stressors on the critical estuarine bivalve Austrovenus stutchburyi. Experiments were used to test the effects of simulated midday low tides combined with chronic warming and oxygen depletion on activity, respiration and survival of A. stutchburyi. A lethal emersion thermal threshold was surpassed at 33 degrees C for treatments exposed to both hypoxic and normoxic treatments, suggesting extreme thermal events such as heatwaves during midday low tides could have substantial detrimental effects on bivalve populations and their vital ecosystem functions. Further, the ability of bivalves to survive heat and desiccation of midday low tide events was much reduced when they were exposed to even minor heat and hypoxia stress when immersed at high tide. The findings of the current study highlight important biological consequences of coastal warming combined with extreme temperature and hypoxic events observed in estuaries.

AB The efficacy of marine protected areas (MPAs) may be reduced when climate change disrupts the ecosystems and human communities around which they are designed. The effects of ocean warming on MPA functioning have received attention but less is known about how multiple climatic stressors may influence MPAs efficacy. Using a novel dataset incorporating 8.8 million oceanographic observations, we assess exposure to potentially stressful temperatures, dissolved oxygen concentrations, and pH levels across the California MPA network. This dataset covers more than two-thirds of California's 124 MPAs and multiple biogeographic domains. However, spatial-temporal and methodological patchiness constrains the extent to which systematic evaluation of exposure is possible across the network. Across a set of nine well-monitored MPAs, the most frequently observed combination of stressful conditions was hypoxic conditions (<140 umol/kg) co-occurring with low pH (<7.75). Conversely, MPAs exposed most frequently to anomalously warm conditions were less likely to experience hypoxia and low pH, although exposure to hypoxia varied throughout the 2014-2016 marine heatwaves. Finally, we found that the spatial patterns of exposure to hypoxia and low pH across the MPA network remained stable across years. This multiple stressor analysis both confirms and challenges prior hypotheses regarding MPA efficacy under global environmental change.

AB Hypoxia has been recognised as an important tumoral feature related to resistance to radiotherapy since 1933. Recent advances in biological research have revealed important aspects on the cellular response to hypoxic stimuli and on the role of hypoxia pathways in the metabolism, growth and progression of cancer. The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1a and HIF-2a) have been identified as key proteins that directly respond to hypoxic stress. Following hypoxia, stabilisation and nuclear binding of HIFs triggers the expression of a variety of genes related to erythropoiesis, glycolysis and angiogenesis. This review reports on and discusses the biology of the hypoxia pathways, the studies performed on the expression of HIFs in human cancer and the implications of hypoxia pathways in cancer therapy.

AB HIF-1 is composed of HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta protein subunits. HIF-1 is induced by hypoxia and binds to promoter / enhancer elements and stimulates the transcription of hypoxia-inducible target genes. Because HIF-1 activation might promote cell survival in hypoxic tissues, we studied the effect of stroke on the expression of HIF-1alpha, HIF-1beta and several HIF-1 target genes in adult rat brain. After focal cerebral ischemia, mRNAs encoding HIF-1alpha, glucose transporter-1 and several glycolytic enzymes including lactate dehydrogenase were up-regulated in the areas around the infarction. HIF and its target genes were induced by 7.5 hours after the onset of ischemia and increased further at 19 and 24 hours. Since hypoxia induces HIF in other tissues, systemic hypoxia (06% O-2 for 4.5h) was also shown to increase HIF-1alpha protein expression in the adult rat brain. It is proposed that decreased blood flow to the penumbra decreases the supply of oxygen and that this induces HIF-1 and its target genes. Because HIF-1 activation may promote cell survival in hypoxic tissues, we studied the effect of hypoxic preconditioning on HIF-1 expression in neonatal rat brain, Hypoxic preconditioning (8% O-2/3hrs), a treatment known to protect the newborn rat brain against hypoxic-ischemic injury, markedly increased HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta expression. We also studied the effect of two other known HIF-1 inducers, cobalt chloride (CoCl2) and desferrioxamine (DFX), on HIF-1 expression and neuroprotection in newborn brain. HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta protein levels were markedly increased after i.p. injection of CoCl2 and DFX. Preconditioning with CoCl2 or DFX 24 hours before the stroke decreased infarction by 75% and 56% respectively, compared with vehicle-injected, littermate controls. Thus, HIF-1 activation could contribute to protective brain preconditioning.

AB Purpose of review
   The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor is activated by low oxygen to promote the expression of target genes that allow cellular, tissue, and organismal adaptation to low oxygen. Hypoxia-inducible factor is activated not only by hypoxia but also as a consequence of genetic mutations in a variety of tumors. This review summarizes recent studies on hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha functions in development and tumorigenesis.
   Recent findings
   Deficiency of the tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau leads to constitutively active hypoxia-inducible factor and hypoxia-inducible factor target gene expression. Other genetic-lesions, however, e.g., in JunD, can also result in elevated hypoxia-inducible factor levels. The specific functions of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha during development and tumor growth remain incompletely understood. Whereas hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha seems to be the critical hypoxia factor in renal cell carcinoma, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha plays a significant role in the growth of tumors in other tissues. Loss of von Hippel-Lindau is not sufficient for neoplastic transformation, suggesting that hypoxia-inducible factor does not act alone to cause tumors. Summary
   It will be important to further characterize the specific roles of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha during tumorigenesis to design therapies targeting the relevant isoform for specific diseases. It is also necessary to investigate the effect of reducing hypoxia-inducible factor levels on other angiogenic factors.

AB Ocean use has always been risky because of uncertain and dramatic ocean conditions and modern businesses continue to experience risk due to environmental extremes. A changing physical environment due to anthropogenic climate change and increased frequency of extreme events such as marine heatwaves makes past experience less valuable. This risk can be reduced by utilising seasonal forecasts that provide early warning of climate events several months ahead of time. However, to benefit from a forecast, a marine business will need to be agile to respond to changing information and response options. We define a set of seven attributes that can influence and enhance this management agility; leadership, social expectations, signal strength, system manipulation, regulatory environment, market forces, and value of the operations. The management agility of different marine businesses in fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism can influence their ability to use seasonal forecast information effectively, and potentially modify the usual negative relationship between resilience and the frequency of the stress event, thus reducing the impact of extreme events. Engagement between forecast developers and marine users can also improve responses, while at the same time, improving the agility of businesses can enhance overall resilience to extreme events and lower their risk.

AB Characterising ocean temperature variability and extremes is fundamental for understanding the thermal bounds in which marine ecosystems have adapted. While there is growing evidence of how marine heatwaves threaten marine ecosystems, prolonged periods of extremely cold ocean temperatures, marine cold-spells, have received less global attention. We synthesize the literature on cold ocean temperature extremes and their ecological impacts and physical mechanisms. Ecological impacts of these events were observed across a range of species and biophysical processes, including mass mortalities, range shifts, marine habitat loss, and altered phenology. The development of marine cold-spells is often due to wind-induced ocean processes, but a range of physical mechanisms are documented in the literature. Given the need for consistent comparison of marine cold-spells, we develop a definition for detecting these events from temperature time series and for classifying them into four categories. This definition is used to consistently detect marine cold-spells globally over the satellite record and to compare the characteristics of notable cold events. Globally, marine cold-spells' occurrence, duration, and intensity are decreasing, with some areas, such as the Southern Ocean, showing signs of increase over the past 15 years. All marine cold-spell categories are affected by these decreases, with the exception of "IV Extreme" events, which were so rare that there has been little decrease. While decreasing occurrences of marine cold-spells could be viewed as providing a beneficial reduction in cold stress for marine ecosystems, fewer cold spells will alter the temperature regime that marine ecosystems experience and could have important consequences on ecological structure and function.

AB Periods of chronic hypoxia, which can arise from numerous cardiorespiratory disorders, predispose individuals to the development of dementias, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is characterized in part by the increased production of amyloid beta peptide (A beta), which forms the extracellular plaques by which the disease can be identified post mortem. Numerous studies have now shown that hypoxia, even in vitro, can increase production of A beta in different cell types. Evidence has been produced to indicate hypoxia alters both expression of the A beta precursor, APP, and also the expression of the secretase enzymes, which cleave A beta from APP. Other studies implicate reduced A beta degradation as a possible means by which hypoxia increases A beta levels. Such variability may be attributable to cell-specific responses to hypoxia. Further evidence indicates that some, but not all of the cellular adaptations to chronic hypoxia (including alteration of Ca2+ homeostasis) require A beta formation. However, other aspects of hypoxic remodeling of cell function appear to occur independently of this process. The molecular and cellular responses to hypoxia contribute to our understanding of the clinical association of hypoxia and increased incidence of AD. However, it remains to be determined whether inhibition of one or more of the effects of hypoxia may be of benefit in arresting the development of this neurodegenerative disease.

AB Tissue hypoxia occurs where there is an imbalance between oxygen supply and consumption. Hypoxia occurs in solid tumours as a result of an inadequate supply of oxygen, due to exponential cellular proliferation and an inefficient vascular supply. It is an adverse prognostic indicator in cancer as it is associated with tumour progression and resistance to therapy. The expression of several genes controlling tumour cell survival are regulated by hypoxia, e.g., growth factors governing the formation of new blood vessels, and hypoxia-responsive transcription factors modulating the expression of genes, which promote tumour cell survival. This review outlines some of the pathways by which tumour hypoxia leads to chemotherapeutic resistance, directly due to lack of oxygen availability, and indirectly due to alterations in the proteome/genome, angiogenesis and pH changes. Some innovative therapies are also detailed which may potentially minimise or eliminate these problems associated with targeting solid tumours. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite huge improvements in the treatment of leukemia, the percentage of patients suffering relapse still remains significant. Relapse most often results from a small number of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) within the bone marrow, which are able to self-renew, and therefore reestablish the full tumor. The marrow microenvironment contributes considerably in supporting the protection and development of leukemic cells. LSCs share specific niches with normal hematopoietic stem cells with the niche itself being composed of a variety of cell types, including mesenchymal stem/stromal cells, bone cells, immune cells, neuronal cells, and vascular cells. A hallmark of the hematopoietic niche is low oxygen partial pressure, indeed this hypoxia is necessary for the long-term maintenance of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Hypoxia is a strong signal, principally maintained by members of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family. In solid tumors, it has been well established that hypoxia triggers intrinsic metabolic changes and microenvironmental modifications, such as the stimulation of angiogenesis, through activation of HIFs. As leukemia is not considered a "solid" tumor, the role of oxygen in the disease was presumed to be inconsequential and remained long overlooked. This view has now been revised since hypoxia has been shown to influence leukemic cell proliferation, differentiation, and resistance to chemotherapy. However, the role of HIF proteins remains controversial with HIFs being considered as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, depending on the study and model. The purpose of this review is to highlight our knowledge of hypoxia and HIFs in leukemic development and therapeutic resistance and to discuss the recent hypoxia-based strategies proposed to eradicate leukemias.

First published March 2, 2011; doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.00044.2011.-Our understanding of organismal responses to hypoxia has stemmed from studies of erythropoietin regulation by hypoxia that led to the discovery of the master regulator of the hypoxic response, i.e., hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). This is a transcription factor that is now known to induce the expression of a battery of genes in response to hypoxia. HIF-1 and HIF-2 regulate many genes that are involved in erythropoiesis and iron metabolism, which are essential for tissue oxygen delivery.

AB In this study, the sedimentary archaeal community composition and abundance were detailed revealed and quantified based on 16S rRNA genes off the Changjiang River Estuary. We found that the community composition was distinct between hypoxia and non-hypoxia regions, while Thaumarchaeota and Bathyarchaeota dominated in non-hypoxia and hypoxia samples, respectively.
   Water hypoxia (DO < 2 mg/L) is a growing global environmental concern that has the potential to significantly influence not only the aquatic ecosystem but also the benthic sedimentary ecosystem. The Changjiang River Estuary hypoxia, classified as one of the world's largest seasonal hypoxic water basins, has been reported to be expanding rapidly in recent decades. However, the microbial community dynamics and responses to this water hypoxia are still unclear. In this study, we examined the abundance, community composition, and distribution of sedimentary archaea, one important component of microbial communities in the Changjiang River Estuary and the East China Sea (ECS). Our results indicated that Thaumarchaeota and Bathyarchaeota were predominant archaeal groups in these research areas, with their 16S rRNA gene abundance ranged from 8.55 x 10(6) to 7.51 x 10(8) and 3.18 x 10(5) to 1.11 x 10(8) copies/g, respectively. The sedimentary archaeal community was mainly influenced by DO, together with the concentration of ammonium, nitrate, and sulfide. In addition, distinct differences in the archaeal community's composition, abundance, and driving factors were discovered between samples from hypoxia and non-hypoxia stations. Furtherly, microbial networks suggest various microbes leading the different activities in hypoxic and normoxic environments. Bathyarchaeota and Thermoprofundales were "key stone" archaeal members of the low-DO network, whereas Thaumarchaeota constituted a significant component of the high-DO network. Our results provide a clear picture of the sedimentary archaeal community in coastal hypoxia zones and indicates potential distinctions of archaea in hypoxia and non-hypoxia environments, including ecological niches and metabolic functions. IMPORTANCE In this study, the sedimentary archaeal community composition and abundance were detailed revealed and quantified based on 16S rRNA genes off the Changjiang River Estuary. We found that the community composition was distinct between hypoxia and non-hypoxia regions, while Thaumarchaeota and Bathyarchaeota dominated in non-hypoxia and hypoxia samples, respectively. In hypoxia regions, the sedimentary archaea were mainly affected by salinity, ammonium, and nitrate, whereas total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and sulfide were major influencing factors in non-hypoxia regions.

Transcriptional responses to hypoxia are enhanced by recurrent hypoxia (hypoxic preconditioning) in the epaulette shark. Physiol Genomics 44: 1090-1097, 2012. First published September 18, 2012; doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00081.2012.-All animals require molecular oxygen for aerobic energy production, and oxygen availability has played a particularly important role in the evolution of aquatic animals. This study investigates how previous exposure to hypoxia (preconditioning) primes protective transcriptional responses in a hypoxia-tolerant vertebrate species, the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum). The epaulette shark is a basal cartilaginous fish that in its natural environment experiences cyclic hypoxic periods. We evaluated whether the transcription of a set of crucial prosurvival genes is affected differently by a single short-term (2 h) exposure to sublethal hypoxia compared with eight such successive hypoxia exposures (hypoxia preconditioning). We discovered that hypoxia preconditioning amplifies transcriptional responses compared with animals that experienced a single hypoxic bout. In the heart we observed that hypoxic preconditioning, but not a single hypoxic exposure, resulted in higher transcript levels of genes that regulate oxygen and energy homeostasis, including those of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, adenosine signaling pathway components, and genes affecting circulation [prostaglandin synthetase 2 (cox-2) and natriuretic peptide C]. This suggests that in a single short-term hypoxic bout, the responses to low oxygen are regulated at the level of pre-existing proteins or translational and posttranslational machinery, whereas transcriptional responses are induced in experiments that parallel the natural environmental cycles of oxygen availability. These findings have general implications for understanding how vertebrates regulate protective gene expression upon physiological stress.

AB By the early 1900s, the close matching of oxygen supply with demand was recognized to be a fundamental requirement for physiological function, and multiple adaptive responses to environment hypoxia had been described. Nevertheless, the widespread operation of mechanisms that directly sense and respond to levels of oxygen in animal cells was not appreciated for most of the twentieth century with investigators generally stressing the regulatory importance of metabolic products. Work over the last 25 years has overturned that paradigm. It has revealed the existence of a set of "oxygen-sensing" 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases that catalyze the hydroxylation of specific amino acid residues and thereby control the stability and activity of hypoxia-inducible factor. The hypoxia-inducible factor hydroxylase pathway regulates a massive transcriptional cascade that is operative in essentially all animal cells. It transduces a wide range of responses to hypoxia, extending well beyond the classical boundaries of hypoxia physiology. Here we review the discovery and elucidation of these pathways, and consider the opportunities and challenges that have been brought into focus by the findings, including new implications for the integrated physiology of hypoxia and therapeutic approaches to ischemic/ hypoxic disease.

AB Effects of chronic hypoxia on chemoreceptors and chemoreflexes in the fetus and neonate are reviewed. The effects are discussed in relation to those in the adult, in which there is an apparent paradox between the increase in chemoreflex gain during acclimatisation to the hypoxia of altitude vs the 'blunting' reported during chronic hypoxia. The possible location and importance of "chemoreceptors" in the brainstem is discussed. In the neonate, chronic hypoxia blunts the ventilatory response to acute hypoxia, an effect largely due to blunting of chemoreceptor sensitivity. Whether this is mediated via a reduction or delay in the normal process of postnatal resetting of hypoxia sensitivity is not known. In addition, there is evidence that the effects on neonatal chemoreceptors are reversible on return to normoxia. Such differences from the adult Suggest that special processes, affected by chronic hypoxia, operate in the neonate. In the fetus there is no direct information on the effect of chronic hypoxia on chemoreceptor responses, but it appears that chemoreflexes are augmented, as may occur in the adult during acclimatisation to hypoxia. Recent evidence suggests that arterial chemoreceptors play an important role in fetal cardiovascular and endocrine responses to prolonged hypoxaemia. This will be a productive avenue for future research. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Hypoxia at the solid tumor site is generally related to the unrestricted proliferation and metabolism of cancerous cells, which can cause tumor metastasis and aggravate tumor progression. Besides, hypoxia plays a substantial role in tumor treatment, and it is one of the main reasons that malignant tumors are difficult to cure and have a poor prognosis. On account of the tumor specific hypoxic environment, many hypoxia-associative nanomedicine have been proposed for tumor treatment. Considering the enhanced targeting effect, designing hypoxia-associative nanomedicine can not only minimize the adverse effects of drugs on normal tissues, but also ach-ieve targeted therapy at the lesion site. Mostly, there can be three strategies for the treatment of hypoxic tumor, including improvement of hypoxic environment, hypoxia responsive drug release and hypoxia activated prodrug. The review describes the design principle and applications of tumor hypoxia-associative nanomedicine in recent years, and also explores its development trends in solid tumor treatment. Moreover, this review presents the current limitations of tumor hypoxia-associative nanomedicine in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy and immunotherapy, which may provide a reference for clinic translation of tumor hypoxia-associative nanomedicine.

AB Coastal hypoxia has become common especially in large river dominated coastal ecosystems. To better quantify the severity of hypoxia and the contribution of hypoxia drivers, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) on observable properties from eight summer hypoxia events in the East China Sea and defined the first principal component as the hypoxia index (HI). Multiple linear regression showed that the HI significantly correlated with three direct hypoxia drivers including water column stratification, subsurface water residence time, and respiration rates, which accounted for 5.7, 55.3, and 34.5%, respectively, of the total variance of PCA derived HI. We further reconstructed the HI over the past 60 years using available long-term data of stratification, model-derived residence times and respiration rates. The results show that summer hypoxia has become more severe since the 1960s. ENSO and global warming may have exacerbated hypoxia by affecting the river discharge, resulting in freshening in the plume-impacted shelf area, while anthropogenic activities may have exacerbated hypoxia by elevating fluvial nutrient concentrations, resulting in higher respiration rates. In addition, warming of the bottom water from the Kuroshio Current accounts for an additional increasing rate for HI, which made hypoxia more severe by means of decreasing oxygen solubility. Overall, our results indicate that stratification, water residence and oxygen solubility resulting from climate change can explain about 80% while higher respiration resulting from higher nutrient inputs can explain about 20% of the variation in the severity of hypoxia during the past half century.

AB Lymphedema is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by edema, fat deposition, and fibrotic tissue remodeling. Despite significant advances in lymphatic biology research, our knowledge of lymphedema pathology is incomplete. Currently, there is no approved pharmacological therapy for this debilitating disease. Hypoxia is a recognized feature of inflammation, obesity, and fibrosis. Understanding hypoxia-regulated pathways in lymphedema may provide new insights into the pathobiology of this chronic disorder and help develop new medicinal treatments.

AB Oxygen is an essential nutrient for cells. Oxygen is delivered to tissues via red blood cells through the vasculature. Molecular mechanisms mediating cellular responses to low oxygen tension have been identified. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are activated by low oxygen and promote transcriptional regulation of downstream effector genes, which lead to cellular adaptations. Controlled hypoxia exposure is utilized as an experimental tool to investigate biological processes, regulating cellular adaptations. Here we describe detailed protocols for hypoxia exposure of pregnant rodent models and low oxygen exposure of trophoblast stem cells, utilizing gas-regulated chamber systems. The presentation also includes phenotypic analyses of the manipulated animal models and cells.

AB The presence of hypoxic regions within solid tumours is associated with a more malignant tumour phenotype and worse prognosis. To obtain a blood supply and protect against cellular damage and death, oxygen-deprived cells in tumours alter gene expression, resulting in resistance to therapy. Hypoxia is sensed at the cellular level, leading to the activation of molecular pathways to cope with this stress. The key mediator of hypoxia response is HIF1 alpha, a member of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of proteins. This protein is a transcription factor that stimulates the expression of a multitude of genes important for adaptation to hypoxia,, including those encoding angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a HIF target gene, to increase blood flow towards oxygen: deprived tissues. This regulation of angiogenesis by hypoxia and HIF is crucial during embryonic development, but also for recovery after ischemic injury, Angiogenesis is one of the physiological responses to hypoxia. Nevertheless, angiogenesis has also deleterious effects by favouring tumour growth.

AB Coastal hypoxia is increasing in the global coastal zone, where it is recognized as a major threat to biota. Managerial efforts to prevent hypoxia and achieve recovery of ecosystems already affected by hypoxia are largely based on nutrient reduction plans. However, these managerial efforts need to be informed by predictions on the thresholds of hypoxia (i.e. the oxygen levels required to conserve biodiversity) as well as the timescales for the recovery of ecosystems already affected by hypoxia. The thresholds for hypoxia in coastal ecosystems are higher than previously thought and are not static, but regulated by local and global processes, being particularly sensitive to warming. The examination of recovery processes in a number of coastal areas managed for reducing nutrient inputs and, thus, hypoxia (Northern Adriatic; Black Sea; Baltic Sea; Delaware Bay; and Danish Coastal Areas) reveals that recovery timescales following the return to normal oxygen conditions are much longer than those of loss following the onset of hypoxia, and typically involve decadal timescales. The extended lag time for ecosystem recovery from hypoxia results in non-linear pathways of recovery due to hysteresis and the shift in baselines, affecting the oxygen thresholds for hypoxia through time.

AB Hypoxia is a common physiologic and pathophysiologic stimulus that activates the expression of genes through oxygen-sensitive transcription factors including the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B). Hypoxia-dependent gene expression can have important physiologic or pathophysiologic consequences for an organism, depending upon the cause of the hypoxic insult. Consequently, this pathway represents an attractive therapeutic target in a number of disease states. While the mechanism linking hypoxia to the activation of HIF has been extensively studied, our understanding of how hypoxia activates NF-kappa B is limited. Recent studies have demonstrated that similar oxygen-sensing mechanisms are employed in conferring oxygen sensitivity to both HIF and NF-kappa B-dependent gene expression. Furthermore, there is an extensive degree of cross-talk occurring between NF-kappa B and HIE Investigations into mechanisms of hypoxic activation of HIF and NF-kappa B and how these signaling pathways interact will uncover new therapeutic modalities in a diverse range of disease states where hypoxia is a feature of the microenvironment including cancer, vascular disease, and chronic inflammation.

AB Purpose Standing balance control is important for everyday function and often goes unnoticed until impairments appear. Presently, more than 200 million people live at altitudes > 2500 m above sea level, and many others work at or travel to these elevations. Thus, it is important to understand how hypoxia alters balance owing to implications for occupations and travelers. Herein, the influence of normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia on standing balance control is reviewed and summarized. As postural control relies on the integration of sensorimotor signals, the potential hypoxic-sensitive neurophysiological factors that contribute to balance impairments are also reviewed. Specifically, we examine how hypoxia impairs visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive cues, and their integration within subcortical or cortical areas.
   Methods This systematic review included a literature search conducted via multiple databases with keywords related to postural balance, hypoxia, and altitude. Articles (n = 13) were included if they met distinct criteria.
   Results Compared to normoxia, normobaric hypoxia worsened parameters of standing balance by 2-10% and up to 83 and 240% in hypobaric hypoxia (high-altitude and lab-based, respectively). Although balance was only disrupted during normobaric hypoxia at FIO2 < similar to 0.15, impairments consistently occurred during hypobaric hypoxia at altitudes > 1524 m (similar to FIO2 < 0.18).
   Conclusion Hypoxia, especially hypobaric, impairs standing balance. The mechanisms underpinning postural decrements likely involve alterations to processing and integration of sensorimotor signals within subcortical or cortical structures involving visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive pathways and subsequent motor commands that direct postural adjustments. Future studies are required to determine the sensorimotor factors that may influence balance control in hypoxia.

AB Sites of inflammation are characterized by significant changes in metabolic activity. Shifts in energy supply and demand can result in diminished delivery and/or availability of oxygen, leading to inflammation-associated tissue hypoxia and metabolic acidosis. These shifts in tissue metabolism, as indicated by previous studies, are frequently associated with vasculitis and profound recruitment of inflammatory cell types, particularly myeloid cells such as neutrophils (PMN) and monocytes. Here, we review recent work addressing the influence of hypoxia on development of inflammatory lesions, with particular emphasis on molecular pathways regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF).

ID SIGNALING PATHWAY; PROTECTS; CANCER
AB Ferroptosis is a novel, iron-dependent cell death characterized by the excessive accumulation of ferroptosis lipid peroxides ultimately leading to oxidative damage to the cell membrane. Iron, lipid, amino acid metabolism, and other signaling pathways all control ferroptosis. Numerous bodily tissues experience hypoxia under normal and pathological circumstances. Tissue cells can adjust to these changes by activating the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling pathway and other mechanisms in response to the hypoxic environment. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that hypoxia and ferroptosis are closely linked, and that hypoxia can regulate ferroptosis in specific cells and conditions through different pathways. In this paper, we review the possible positive and negative regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis by hypoxia-inducible factors, as well as ferroptosisassociated ischemic diseases, with the intention of delivering novel therapeutic avenues for the defense and management of hypoxic illnesses linked to ferroptosis.

AB Hypoxia frequently accompanies such vascular disorders as atherosclerosis, thrombosis and ischemia/reperfusion injury. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, in particular, is a major contributor to cardiomyocyte impairment. Autophagy is a dynamic, self-catabolic process that has been implicated in a wide range of physiological processes and the pathogenesis of diverse diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate the promotion of autophagy by hypoxia in a rat H9c2 heart cell line and determine the regulatory role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in the hypoxia-induced autophagy in H9c2 cells, using quantitative green fluorescent protein-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 analysis and electron microscopy of autophagic vesicles. In addition, western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of autophagy-associated markers was conducted. In addition, the role of HIF-1-mediated autophagy in the hypoxia-induced impairment of H9c2 cells was examined, as a measure of cellular viability, using an MTT assay. The results demonstrated that autophagy was induced in H9c2 cells under hypoxia, and the autophagy induction triggered by hypoxia could be enhanced by HIF-1 alpha overexpression and inhibited by HIF-1 alpha knockdown. Furthermore, the HIF-1-mediated autophagy ameliorated the reduction in the H9c2 cell viability induced by hypoxia. These findings provide a novel insight into the hypoxic-ischemic injury to cardiomyocytes and give evidence for the occurrence of HIF-1-mediated autophagy in myocardial ischemia.

AB Regions of reduced oxygenation (hypoxia) are a characteristic feature of virtually all animal and human solid tumours. Numerous preclinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, have shown that decreasing oxygen concentration induces resistance to radiation. Importantly, hypoxia in human tumours is a negative indicator of radiotherapy outcome. Hypoxia also contributes to resistance to other cancer therapeutics, including immunotherapy, and increases malignant progression as well as cancer cell dissemination. Consequently, substantial effort has been made to detect hypoxia in human tumours and identify realistic approaches to overcome hypoxia and improve cancer therapy outcomes. Hypoxia-targeting strategies include improving oxygen availability, sensitising hypoxic cells to radiation, preferentially killing these cells, locating the hypoxic regions in tumours and increasing the radiation dose to those areas, or applying high energy transfer radiation, which is less affected by hypoxia. Despite numerous clinical studies with each of these hypoxia-modifying approaches, many of which improved both local tumour control and overall survival, hypoxic modification has not been established in routine clinical practice. Here we review the background and significance of hypoxia, how it can be imaged clinically and focus on the various hypoxia-modifying techniques that have undergone, or are currently in, clinical evaluation.

AB Hypoxia is a common characteristic of many types of solid tumors. Intratumoral hypoxia selects for tumor cells that survive in a low oxygen environment, undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition, are more motile and invasive, and show gene expression changes driven by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) activation. Therefore, targeting HIF-1 alpha is an attractive strategy for disrupting multiple pathways crucial for tumor growth. In the present study, we demonstrated that hypoxia increases the S-glutathionylation of HIF-1 alpha and its protein levels in colon cancer cells. This effect is significantly prevented by decreasing oxidized glutathione as well as glutathione depletion, indicating that S-glutathionylation and the formation of protein-glutathione mixed disulfides is related to HIF-1 alpha protein levels. Moreover, colon cancer cells expressing glutaredoxin 1 are resistant to inducing HIF-1 alpha and expressing hypoxia-responsive genes under hypoxic conditions. Therefore, S-glutathionylation of HIF-1 alpha induced by tumor hypoxia may be a novel therapeutic target for the development of new drugs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB P-selectin is an endothelial adhesion molecule involved in the initial step of the neutrophil recruitment. We investigated the effect of hypoxia (95% N-2, 5% CO2) and of hypoxia-reoxygenation (95% air, 5% CO2) on the expression of P-selectin by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). P-selectin expression was detected by immunolabelling and quantified by flow cytometric analysis.
   Our data indicate that hypoxia induces an increase in P-selectin expression with a maximum reached after 90 minutes. A hypoxic exposure of 90 minutes results in a highly significant increase compared to normoxia (p<0.001, n=13). Furthermore, when a reoxygenation period follows 90 minutes of hypoxia, the initially elevated levels of P-selectin are dramatically enhanced with a maximum obtained after 60 minutes of reoxygenation.

AB Tumor hypoxia is associated with resistance to treatment, aggressive growth, metastatic dissemination, and poor clinical outcome in many cancer types. The potential of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to assess the extent of hypoxia in tumors has been investigated in several studies in our laboratory. Cervical carcinoma, melanoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) xenografts have been used as models of human cancer, and the transfer rate constant (K-trans) and the extravascular extracellular volume fraction (v(e)) have been derived from DCE-MRI data by using Tofts standard pharmacokinetic model and a population-based arterial input function.K(trans)was found to reflect naturally occurring and treatment-induced hypoxia when hypoxia was caused by low blood perfusion, radiation responsiveness when radiation resistance was due to hypoxia, and metastatic potential when metastasis was hypoxia-induced.K(trans)was also associated with outcome for patients with locally-advanced cervical carcinoma treated with cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy. Together, the studies imply that DCE-MRI can provide valuable information on the hypoxic status of cervical carcinoma, melanoma, and PDAC. In this communication, we review and discuss the studies and provide some recommendations as to how DCE-MRI data can be analyzed and interpreted to assess tumor hypoxia.

AB Pulmonary neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs), presumed polymodal airway sensors, consist of innervated clusters of amine (serotonin) and peptide-producing cells. While NEB responses to acute hypoxia are mediated by a membrane-bound O-2 sensor complex, responses to sustained and/or chronic hypoxia involve a prolyl hydroxylase (PHD)-hypoxia-induciblefactor-dependent mechanism. We have previously reported hyperplasia of NEBs in the lungs of Phd1-/- mice associated with enhanced serotonin secretion. Here we use a novel multilabel immunofluorescence method to assess NEB distribution, frequency, and size, together with the number and size of NEB cell nuclei, and to colocalize multiple cytoplasmic and nuclear epitopes in the lungs of Phd1-/-, Phd2+/-, and Phd3-/- mice and compare them with wild-type controls. To define the mechanisms of NEB cell hyperplasia, we used antibodies against Mash1 and Prox1 (neurogenic genes involved in NEB cell differentiation/maturation), hypoxia-inducible factor1alpha, and the cell proliferation marker Ki67. Morphometric analysis of (% total lung area) immunostaining for synaptophysin (% synaptophysin), a cytoplasmic marker of NEB cells, was significantly increased in Phd1-/- and Phd3-/- mice compared to wild-type mice. In addition, NEB size and the number and size of NEB nuclei were also significantly increased, indicating that deficiency of Phds is associated with striking hyperplasia and hypertrophy of NEBs. In Phd2+/- mice, while mean % synaptophysin was comparable to wild-type controls, the NEB size was moderately increased, suggesting an effect even in heterozygotes. NEBs in all Phd-deficient mice showed increased expression of Mash1, Prox1, Ki67, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, in keeping with enhanced differentiation from precursor cells and a minor component of cell proliferation. Since the loss of PHD activity mimics chronic hypoxia, our data provide critical information on the potential role of PHDs in the pathobiology and mechanisms of NEB cell hyperplasia that is relevant to a number of pediatric lung disorders.

AB Tumor tissues are chronically exposed to hypoxia owing to aberrant vascularity. Hypoxia induces metabolic alterations in cancer, thereby promoting aggressive malignancy and metastasis. While previous efforts largely focused on adaptive responses in glucose and glutamine metabolism, recent studies have begun to yield important insight into the hypoxic regulation of lipid metabolic reprogramming in cancer. Emerging evidence points to lipid droplet (LD) accumulation as a hallmark of hypoxic cancer cells. One critical underlying mechanism involves the inhibition of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL)-mediated intracellular lipolysis by a small protein encoded by hypoxia-inducible gene 2 (HIG2), also known as hypoxia inducible lipid droplet associated (HILPDA). In this review we summarize and discuss recent key findings on hypoxia-dependent regulation of metabolic adaptations especially lipolysis in cancer. We also pose several questions and hypotheses pertaining to the metabolic impact of lipolytic regulation in cancer under hypoxia and during hypoxia-reoxygenation transition.

AB Climate change projections indicate more frequent and severe tropical marine heat waves (MHWs) and accompanying hypoxia year-round. However, most studies have focused on peak summer conditions under the assumption that annual maximum temperatures will induce the greatest physiological consequences. This study chal- lenges this idea by characterizing seasonal MHWs (i.e., mean, maximum, and cumula- tive intensities, durations, heating rates, and mean annual occurrence) and comparing metabolic traits (i.e., standard metabolic rate (SMR), Q10 of SMR, maximum metabolic rate (MMR), aerobic scope, and critical oxygen tension (Pcrit)) of winter-and summer acclimatized convict tang (Acanthurus triostegus) to the combined effects of MHWs and hypoxia. Fish were exposed to one of six MHW treatments with seasonally var- ying maximum intensities (winter: 24.5, 26.5, 28.5 degrees C; summer: 28.5, 30.5, 32.5 degrees C), representing past and future MHWs under IPCC projections (i.e., +0, +2, +4 degrees C). Surprisingly, MHW characteristics did not significantly differ between seasons, yet SMR was more sensitive to winter MHWs (mean Q10 = 2.92) than summer MHWs (mean Q10 = 1.81), despite higher absolute summer temperatures. Concurrently, MMR increased similarly among winter +2 and +4 degrees C treatments (i.e., 26.5, 28.5 degrees C) and all summer MHW treatments, suggesting a ceiling for maximal MMR increase. Aerobic scope did not significantly differ between seasons nor among MHW treat- ments. While mean Pcrit did not significantly vary between seasons, warming of +4 degrees C during winter (i.e., 28.5 degrees C) significantly increased Pcrit relative to the winter control group. Contrary to the idea of increased sensitivity to MHWs during the warmest time of year, our results reveal heightened sensitivity to the deleterious effects of winter MHWs, and that seasonal acclimatization to warmer summer conditions may bolster metabolic resilience to warming and hypoxia. Consequently, physiological sen- sitivity to MHWs and hypoxia may extend across larger parts of the year than previ- ously expected, emphasizing the importance of evaluating climate change impacts during cooler seasons when essential fitness-related traits such as reproduction occur in many species.

AB Hypoxia is an important characteristic of most solid malignancies, and is closely related to tumor prognosis and therapeutic resistance. Hypoxia is one of the most important factors associated with resistance to conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Therapies targeting tumor hypoxia have attracted considerable attention. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) are bioreductive drugs that are selectively activated under hypoxic conditions and that can accurately target the hypoxic regions of solid tumors. Both single-agent and combined use with other drugs have shown promising antitumor effects. In this review, we discuss the mechanism of action and the current preclinical and clinical progress of several of the most widely used HAPs, summarize their existing problems and shortcomings, and discuss future research prospects.

AB Hypoxia is a hallmark of tumors leading to (mal-)adaptive processes, development of aggressive phenotypes and treatment resistance. Based on underlying mechanisms and their duration, two main types of hypoxia have been identified, coexisting with complex spatial and temporal heterogeneities. Chronic hypoxia is mainly caused by diffusion limitations due to enlarged diffusion distances and adverse diffusion geometries (e. g., concurrent vs. countercurrent microvessels, Krogh- vs. Hill-type diffusion geometry) and, to a lesser extent, by hypoxemia (e. g., in anemic patients, HbCO formation in heavy smokers), and a compromised perfusion or flow stop (e. g., due to disturbed Starling forces or intratumor solid stress). Acute hypoxia mainly results from transient disruptions in perfusion (e. g., vascular occlusion by cell aggregates), fluctuating red blood cell fluxes or short-term contractions of the interstitial matrix. In each of these hypoxia subtypes oxygen supply is critically reduced, but perfusion-dependent nutrient supply, waste removal, delivery of anticancer or diagnostic agents, and repair competence can be impaired or may not be affected. This detailed differentiation of tumor hypoxia may impact on our understanding of tumor biology and may aid in the development of novel treatment strategies, tumor detection by imaging and tumor targeting, and is thus of great clinical relevance.

AB Adequate oxygen supply is essential for maintaining the body's normal physiological function. In chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), insufficient oxygen reaching the intestine triggers the regulatory system in response to environmental changes. However, the pathogenesis of IBD is still under investigation. Recent research has highlighted the significant role of hypoxia in IBD, particularly the involvement of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and their regulatory mechanisms, making them promising therapeutic targets for IBD. This review will delve into the role of hypoxia, HIF, and the associated hypoxia-inflammatory microenvironment in the context of IBD. Potential interventions for addressing these challenging gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases will also be discussed within this framework.

AB Hypoxia is a pervasive stressor in aquatic environments, and both phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptation could shape the ability to cope with hypoxia. We investigated evolved variation in hypoxia tolerance and the hypoxia acclimation response across fundulid killifishes that naturally experience different patterns of hypoxia exposure. We compared resting O-2 consumption rate ((M)over dot(O2)), and various indices of hypoxia tolerance [critical O-2 tension (P-crit), regulation index (RI), O-2 tension (PO2) at loss of equilibrium (P-LOE) and time to LOE (t(LOE)) at 0.6 kPa O-2] in Fundulus confluentus, Fundulus diaphanus, Fundulus heteroclitus, Fundulus rathbuni, Lucania goodei and Lucania parva. We examined the effects of chronic (28 days) exposure to constant hypoxia (2 kPa) or nocturnal intermittent hypoxia (12 h normoxia:12 h hypoxia) in a subset of species. Some species exhibited a two-breakpoint model in (M)over dot(O2) caused by early, modest declines in (M)over dot(O2) in moderate hypoxia. We found that hypoxia tolerance varied appreciably across species: F. confluentus was the most tolerant (lowest P-LOE and P-crit, longest t(LOE)), whereas F. rathbuni and F. diaphanus were the least tolerant. However, there was not a consistent pattern of interspecific variation for different indices of hypoxia tolerance, with or without taking phylogenetic relatedness into account, probably because these different indices are underlain by partially distinct mechanisms. Hypoxia acclimation generally improved hypoxia tolerance, but the magnitude of plasticity and responsiveness to different hypoxia patterns varied interspecifically. Our results therefore suggest that hypoxia tolerance is a complex trait that is best appreciated by considering multiple indices of tolerance.

AB It is of fundamental importance to differentiate whether chronic hypoxia occurs intermittently or persistently. While chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is found typically in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OAS), chronic persistent hypoxia (CPH) is typically diagnosed in patients with chronic lung disease. Cardiovascular risk is markedly increased in patients with CIH compared to patients with CPH. The frequent change between oxygen desaturation and reoxygenation in patients with CIH is associated with increased hypoxic stress, increased systemic inflammation, and enhanced adrenergic activation followed by endothelial dysfunction and increased arteriosclerosis. The pathophysiologic consequences of CPH are less well understood. The relationship between CPH and the development of pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary heart disease as well as polycythemia has been established.

AB Conclusive research has shown that regions of acute/chronic hypoxia, which exist within the majority of solid tumours, have a profound influence on the therapeutic outcome of cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy and are a strong prognostic factor of disease progression and survival. A strong argument therefore exists for assessing the hypoxic fraction of tumours, prior to patient treatment, and to tailor this treatment accordingly. Tumour hypoxia also provides a powerful physiological stimulus that can be exploited as a tumour-specific condition, allowing for the rationale design of hypoxia-activated anticancer drugs or novel hypoxia-regulated gene therapy strategies.

AB The ability to sense and respond to changes in cellular oxygen levels is critical for aerobic organisms and requires a molecular oxygen sensor. The prototypical sensor is the oxygen-dependent enzyme PHD: hypoxia inhibits its ability to hydroxylate the transcription factor HIF, causing HIF to accumulate and trigger the classic HIF-dependent hypoxia response. A small handful of other oxygen sensors are known, all of which are oxygen-dependent enzymes. However, hundreds of oxygen-dependent enzymes exist among aerobic organisms, raising the possibility that additional sensors remain to be discovered. This review summarizes known and potential hypoxia sensors among human O-2-dependent enzymes and highlights their possible roles in hypoxia-related adaptation and diseases.

AB A wide variety of imaging approaches have been developed in the past few decades for monitoring tumor oxygenation and hypoxia in vivo. In particular, nuclear medicine has seen the development of several radiolabeled hypoxia markers and is the preferred method for imaging of tumor hypoxia. Hypoxia imaging is increasingly being used in the clinical setting and is progressing from a mere detection method to application in individualization of chemoradiotherapy.

AB Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal subtype of breast cancer. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) have shown promise as potential therapeutic agents for TNBC. While increasing hypoxia levels may promote the HAP activation, it raises concerns regarding HIF1 alpha-dependent drug resistance. It is desirable to develop a targeted approach that enhances tumor hypoxia for HAP activation without promoting HIF1 alpha dependent drug resistance in TNBC treatment. Herein, we proposed a multi-responsive carrier-free selfassembled nanomedicine named AQ4N@CA4T1ASO. This nanomedicine first targeted tumors by the TNBCtargeting aptamers (T1), and then disassembled in the reductive and acidic conditions within tumors. The released Combretastatin 4 (CA4) could exacerbate hypoxia, thereby promoting the conversion of inactive Banoxantrone (AQ4N) to its active form, AQ4. Simultaneously, the released antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) could attenuate hypoxia-induced HIF1 alpha mRNA expression, thereby sensitizing the tumor to chemotherapy. Overall, this smart nanomedicine represents a profound targeted therapy strategy, combining "hypoxia-potentiating, hypoxia-activated, chemo-sensitization" approaches for TNBC treatment. In vivo study demonstrated significant suppression of tumor growth, highlighting the promising potential of this nanomedicine for future clinical translation.

AB Although both chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) and chronic continuous hypoxia (CCH) have effects on hemorheology, we do not know whether their roles are the same. In this study, we explored the effect of simulated-apnea CIH on hemorheology in experimental rats and compared with the effect of CCH. 45 adult SD rats were randomly divided into the normoxic control group, CCH and CIH groups. CIH rats were given nitrogen and air alternately for 8 hours per day and the experiment lasted for 5 weeks. The control group were placed in the normoxia animal chambers, and the CCH rats were housed in the same chambers which were continuously given normobaric hypoxia (FiO(2) = 10%). After the preparations, the blood samples were taken and the hemorheology were determined. Compared with control group, the whole blood apparent viscosity, plasma viscosity, hematocrit, erythrocyte aggregation index and electrophoresis index, platelet aggregation rate and fibrinogen significantly increased in CIH group and CCH group. The whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, hematocrit and fibrinogen values were much higher in CCH group than in CIH group. However, there was not significantly difference in RBC deformation index or rigidity index among the three groups and no significantly differences were found in the effects on RBC rheological property between CIH and CCH. Our results suggest that intermittent hypoxia and continuous hypoxia increase whole blood viscosity, impair the functions of red blood cells and promote the platelet aggregation in model rats. Moreover, CCH had a greater effect on blood rheology than CIH.

AB Purpose: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the most common form of silent liver disease in the United States and obesity is associated with increased risk of NAFLD. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which is common in obese individuals is associated with a greater incidence of NAFLD, which in turn, increases the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is unclear how obesity, OSA and NAFLD interrelate nor how they collectively contribute to an increased risk for developing HCC.
   Patients and methods: Male BALB/c mice were exposed to diethylnitrosamine and phenobarbital followed by 48 weeks of either standard chow diet (chow), chow with hypoxia, high-fat diet, or a combination of hypoxia and high-fat diet. We noninvasively monitored tumor development using micro-CT imaging. We tracked the total weight gained throughout the study. We evaluated liver histology, fat accumulation, carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 alpha) expression, as well as, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).
   Results: A high-fat diet without hypoxia led to the development of obesity that induced hepatic steatosis and promoted tumorigenesis. Animals on a high-fat diet and that were also exposed to hypoxia had lower total weight gain, lower steatosis, lower serum AST and ALT levels, and fewer number of hepatic adenomas than a high-fat diet without hypoxia.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that hypoxia abrogates obesity, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic tumorigenesis related to a high-fat diet.

AB All aircrews are required to undertake the altitude hypoxia training and be familiarized with the hypobaric effect on their physiological regulation. Due to the characteristics of the helicopter aircrafts, few researches have reported in-flight hypoxia events among the helicopter aircrews. The main goal of this study was designed to compare the hypoxia symptoms of helicopter aircrews between the altitude hypoxia training and during flight. We developed a questionnaire to collect the details of chamber flights and in-flight hypoxia events in 2019. All data were managed by the SPSS software and two-tailed 0.05 alpha level was considered as a significant level. Of the 213 study participants, there were eight (3.8%) cases that experienced hypoxia symptoms during the flight. The top five symptoms that appeared both in the last and current altitude hypoxia trainings were visual impairment (20.7%), difficulty concentrating (12.7%), tiredness (12.2%), cognitive impairment (8.0%), and air hunger (5.2%). Meanwhile, the frequency of those symptoms above was not significantly different from the last or current training compared with those in-flight hypoxia events. The survey unveiled a series of consistency correlations of hypoxia symptoms between the chamber flights and in-flight environment for the helicopter aircrew group.

AB A hypoxic environment can be defined as a region of the body or the whole body that is deprived of oxygen. Hypoxia is a feature of many diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, tissue trauma, stroke, and solid cancers. A loss of oxygen supply usually results in cell death; however, when cells gradually become hypoxic, they may survive and continue to thrive as described for conditions that promote metastatic growth. The role of hypoxia in these pathogenic pathways is therefore of great interest, and understanding the effect of hypoxia in regulating these mechanisms is fundamentally important. This chapter gives an extensive overview of these mechanisms. Moreover, given the challenges posed by tumor hypoxia we describe the current methods to simulate and detect hypoxic conditions followed by a discussion on current and experimental therapies that target hypoxic cells.

AB Purpose Hypoxia is a condition of insufficient oxygen to support metabolism which occurs when the vascular supply is interrupted, or when a tumour outgrows its vascular supply. It is a negative prognostic factor due to its association with an aggressive tumour phenotype and therapeutic resistance. This review provides an overview of hypoxia imaging with Positron emission tomography (PET), with an emphasis on the biological relevance, mechanism of action, highlighting advantages, and limitations of the currently available hypoxia radiotracers.
   Methods A comprehensive PubMed literature search was performed, identifying articles relating to biological significance and measurement of hypoxia, MRI methods, and PET imaging of hypoxia in preclinical and clinical settings, up to December 2016.
   Results A variety of approaches have been explored over the years for detecting and monitoring changes in tumour hypoxia, including regional measurements with oxygen electrodes placed under CT guidance, MRI methods that measure either oxygenation or lactate production consequent to hypoxia, different nuclear medicine approaches that utilise imaging agents the accumulation of which is inversely related to oxygen tension, and optical methods. The advantages and disadvantages of these approaches are reviewed, along with individual strategies for validating different imaging methods. PET is the preferred method for imaging tumour hypoxia due to its high specificity and sensitivity to probe physiological processes in vivo, as well as the ability to provide information about intracellular oxygenation levels.
   Conclusion Even though hypoxia could have significant prognostic and predictive value in the clinic, the best method for hypoxia assessment has in our opinion not been realised.

AB In humans and cats the ventilatory response to 30 min of isocapnic hypoxia is biphasic with an initial increase followed by a decrease, termed ''hypoxic depression.'' In humans, 30 min of hypoxia reduces the initial response to a subsequent hypoxic exposure. These experiments were to determine whether the same occurred in cats. Cats were studied while awake. End-tidal PO2 and PCO2 were measured by sampling tracheal gas, and ventilation was measured plethysmographically. In seven cats we measured ventilatory responses to two 30-min periods of isocapnic hypoxia (end-tidal PO2 = 60-65 Torr) separated by 5 min of room air breathing. The first hypoxic response was biphasic, with ventilation increasing to 149% of control at 5 min and decreasing to 117% of control at 25 min. During the second exposure, ventilation was 119% of control at 5 min and 113% of control at 25 min; 30 min of hypoxia depressed the subsequent hypoxic response. Hypoxic depression outlasted the hypoxia, suggesting that it was mediated by relatively slow neurochemical events. In five cats ventilatory responses to 5% CO2 were measured before and 5 min after 30 min of isocapnic hypoxia and before and after 30 min of room air breathing. Hypoxia did not affect CO2 responses. Thus the neurochemical events that cause hypoxic depression appear not to involve the neurons generating the response to CO2 and may be specific to those involved in the hypoxic response.

AB Hypoxia is an important feature of most solid tumors, conferring resistance to radiation and many forms of chemotherapy. However, it is possible to exploit the presence of tumor hypoxia with hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs), agents that in low oxygen conditions undergo bioreduction to yield cytotoxic metabolites. Although many such agents have been developed, we will focus here on TH-302. TH-302 has been extensively studied, and we discuss its mechanism of action, as well as its efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies, with the aim of identifying future research directions.

AB Oxygen represents one of the major molecules required for the development and maintenance of life. An adequate response to hypoxia is therefore required for the functioning of the majority of living organisms and relies on the activation of the hypoxia-inducible - factor (HIF) pathway. HIF prolyl hydroxylase domain-2 (PHD2) has long been recognized as the major regulator of this response, controlling a myriad of outcomes that range from cell death to proliferation. However, this enzyme has been associated with more pathways, making the role of this protein remarkably complex under distinct pathologies. While a protective role seems to exist in physiological conditions such as erythropoiesis; the picture is more complex during pathologies such as cancer. Since the regulation of this enzyme and its closest family members is currently considered as a possible therapy for various diseases, understanding the different particular roles of this protein is essential.

AB Hypoxia is a non-physiological level of oxygen tension, a phenomenon common in a majority of malignant tumors. Tumor-hypoxia leads to advanced but dysfunctional vascularization and acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype resulting in cell mobility and metastasis. Hypoxia alters cancer cell metabolism and contributes to therapy resistance by inducing cell quiescence. Hypoxia stimulates a complex cell signaling network in cancer cells, including the HIF, PI3K, MAPK, and NF kappa B pathways, which interact with each other causing positive and negative feedback loops and enhancing or diminishing hypoxic effects. This review provides background knowledge on the role of tumor hypoxia and the role of the HIF cell signaling involved in tumor blood vessel formation, metastasis, and development of the resistance to therapy. Better understanding of the role of hypoxia in cancer progression will open new windows for the discovery of new therapeutics targeting hypoxic tumor cells and hypoxic microenvironment.

AB Hypoxia is the main cause and effect of a large number of diseases, including the most recent one facing the world, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Hypoxia is divided into short-term, longterm, and periodic, it can be the result of diseases, climate change, or living and traveling in the high mountain regions of the world. Since each type of hypoxia can be a cause and a consequence of various physiological changes, the methods for modeling these hypoxias are also different. There are many techniques for modeling hypoxia under experimental conditions. The most common animal for modeling hypoxia is a rat. Hypoxia models (hypoxia simulations) in rats are a tool to study the effect of various conditions on the oxygen supply of the body. These models can provide a necessary information to understand hypoxia and also provide effective treatment, highlighting the importance of various reactions of the body to hypoxia. The main parameters when choosing a model should be reproducibility and the goal that the scientist wants to achieve. Hypoxia in rats can be reproduced both ways exogenously and endogenously. The reason for writing this review was the aim to systematize the models of rats available in the literature in order to facilitate their selection by scientists. The relative strengths and limitations of each model need to be identified and understood in order to evaluate the information obtained from these models and extrapolate these results to humans to develop the necessary generalizations. Despite these problems, animal models have been and remain vital to understanding the mechanisms involved in the development and progression of hypoxia. The eligibility criteria for the selected studies was a comprehensive review of the methods and results obtained from the studies. This made it possible to make generalizations and give recommendations on the application of these methods. The review will assist scientists in choosing an appropriate hypoxia simulation method, as well as assist in interpreting the results obtained with these methods.

AB Marine heatwaves (MHWs) and Cold Spells (marine cold spells (MCSs)) are events of extreme positive and negative temperature anomalies, that last 5 days or longer. These events have been diagnosed across oceans from sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and recognized to affect ecosystems' health worldwide. Some studies have focused on the extent, evolution, and drivers of specifically intense and long-lasting regional MHW events. Although extreme temperature anomalies could lead to coral bleaching, mortality, and ecosystems' shift from healthy to barren reefs, no studies have focused on MHWs and MCSs in the Caribbean Sea. This study characterizes them in the Caribbean Sea, explores simultaneous thermal-stress and coral response, and reveals prevailing environmental conditions during their occurrence. We use four decades of SSTs observed daily and a recently published database of worldwide coral bleaching events. We found bleaching events occurring simultaneously with both MCSs and MHWs, often with extreme events of mild intensity and typical duration. We find a positive long-term trend in MHWs' frequency, consistent not only with global warming, but also with the Atlantic Meridional Mode. There is a clear seasonal signal with MHWs occurring more often in summer and MCSs in autumn-winter. Our results suggest MHWs and MCSs development is related to El Nino/La Nina conditions, respectively. Finally, we identify intense extreme temperature events that span large areas as candidates for future studies on their dynamics. Our results are relevant for the development of MHWs and MCSs forecasts applied to conservation strategies and ecosystem-based management of marine resources, particularly in reef systems.
   Events of extremely warm and cold temperatures that last 5 days or longer in the ocean are denominated Marine Heatwaves (MHWs) and marine cold spells (MCSs), respectively. Analysis of sea surface temperature observed with satellites over the past decades have shown MHWs are occurring more often and have important ecological implications. This study focuses on MHWs and MCSs in the Caribbean Sea over the last four decades to: (a) determine their typical duration, intensity, and frequency; (b) explore if their occurrence coincides with recorded coral bleaching events; (c) determine their temporal variability, as well as correlation with climate indices; and (d) identify the largest and most intense MHW and MCS events. We present evidence of Caribbean MCSs and MHWs linked to widespread coral bleaching. Additionally, we reveal MHWs/MCSs occur more often during summer/winter and El Nino/La Nina conditions and show an increase in MHWs' frequency consistent with long-term warming, and natural climate modes of variability such as the Atlantic Meridional Mode. Our findings contribute to the improvement of tools that anticipate MHWs and MCSs for the management of reefs, which are ecosystems that host large biodiversity, support societal needs, and that are under pressure due to ongoing climate change.
   Caribbean marine heatwave (MHW) and marine cold spell (MCS) are simultaneous with coral bleaching eventsMHWs/MCSs have a seasonal signal, being more frequent and intense during summer/autumn-winter and in the SE region of the CaribbeanMHWs/MCSs are longer, stronger, and more frequent during the +/- phase of Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, Atlantic Meridional Mode and Caribbean, and occur more often during +/- El Nino Southern Oscillation conditions

AB Hypoxia, one of the most common causes of kidney injury, is a key pathological condition in various kidney diseases. Renal fibrosis is the terminal pathway involved in the continuous progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), characterized by glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF). Recent studies have shown that hypoxia is a key factor promoting the progression of TIF. Loss of microvasculature, reduced oxygen dispersion, and metabolic abnormality of cells in the kidney are the main causes of the hypoxic state. Hypoxia can, in turn, profoundly affect the tubular epithelial cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, and progenitor cells. In this chapter, we reviewed the critical roles of hypoxia in the pathophysiology of TIF and discussed the potential of anti-hypoxia as its promising therapeutic target.

ID ARTERIAL-HYPERTENSION; MECHANISMS
AB Objectives: High-altitude pulmonary hypertension (HAPH) is a worldwide public health issue in mountainous areas, while the underlying mechanism of it is still unclear. This study aims to establish a rat model of hypobaric hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension through sustained exposure to a simulated high altitude atmospheric environment in plain area. Methods: Twelve healthy male SD rats were randomly and equally divided into a model group and a control group. The model group was housed in an automatic adjusting hypobaric hypoxia chamber for 4 weeks, and the control group was housed under normobaric normoxic condition in the same room. The mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), right ventricular pressure (RVSP), the right ventricle (RV) weight, left ventricular (LV) weight, interventricular septum (S) weight, right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI), hematoxylin-eosinstaining, elastic fibers staining, ratio of the thickness of vascular wall to its outer diameter (MT%), ratio of the cross-sectional area of the middle vascular wall to the total vascular cross-sectional area (MA%), alpha-SMA positive ratio were detected to evaluate the pulmonary hypertension. Results: As compared to that in control group, rats in model group showed significant increases on mPAP (36.39 +/- 4.26 mmHg versus 16.27 +/- 6.99 mmHg, P<0.001), RVSP (45.29 +/- 6.09 mmHg versus 28.12 +/- 4.67mmHg, P<0.001), RVHI (0.44 +/- 0.08 versus 0.18 +/- 0.05, P<0.001), MT% (44.50 +/- 8.96 versus 19.50 +/- 4.88, P<0.001), MA% (64.00 +/- 6.66 versus 40.45 +/- 7.08, P<0.001), alpha-SMA positive% (57.00 +/- 6.87 versus 30.50 +/- 6.83, P<0.001). Conclusion: The rat model of hypobaric hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension has been successfully established by automatic adjusting hypobaric hypoxia chamber. Sustained exposure to a low oxygen environment at a simulate-altitude of 5,000 meter for 4 weeks have caused the pathological remodeling of pulmonary vascular walls and pulmonary hypertension, and further led to a series of pathological changes, including right ventricular hypertrophy. This model is easy to be replicated with good reproducibility and can be widely used in further studies.

AB Hypoxia due to rapid tumor growth with impaired neovascularization and inflammation resulting from immune cell activation are hallmarks of cancer. Hypoxia-inducible factors control transcriptional adaptation in response to low oxygen conditions, both in tumor and immune cells. In addition, sphingolipids become increasingly recognized as important cell mediators in tumor and inflammatory hypoxia. Recent studies have identified acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), a central enzyme in the sphingolipid metabolism, as a regulator of several types of stress stimuli pathways and an important player in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, this review will address the connection between the hypoxic response and the ASM/ceramide system in the context of inflammatory hypoxia.

AB The distribution and intensity of hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen) in estuaries is increasing worldwide due to cultural eutrophication. This study quantifies the strength of associations between the duration of diel-cycling severe hypoxia (a parts per thousand currency sign2 mg O-2 l(-1)) in bottom water (similar to 15 cm above bottom) of a shallow (< 2 m) coastal lagoon estuary (Delaware, USA) and abiotic environmental variables (water temperature, insolation, tide, streamflow, and wind) and predicts the duration of severe hypoxia given different combinations of these variables. The intensity and spatial extent and dynamics of diel-cycling severe hypoxia events were defined. Vertical variability in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration during the daytime was also determined. During the summers of 2001-2005, bottom DO data were collected for periods of weeks to months at multiple sites using automated sondes. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and regression tree analysis (RTA) were used to determine the relative importance of the environmental variables in predicting the number of hours of severe hypoxia per day. Key findings of the study were that severe hypoxia events of minutes to hours in duration occurred frequently in all four tributaries sampled, primarily between 0200 and 1000 hours. Severe hypoxia duration and diel-cycling amplitudes of DO concentration increased in the up-tributary direction. Hierarchically, the duration of severe hypoxia was influenced mostly by the mean daily water temperature, then by preceding days' total insolation, percentage of morning hours (02:00 to 10:00 a.m.) ebb tide, and daily streamflow. Collectively, the variables examined by the MLR and the RTA approaches accounted for 62% and 65% of the variability in the duration of severe hypoxia, respectively. RTA demonstrated that daily mean water temperature above 26.3A degrees C and previous day's total insolation below 13.6 kW m(-2) were associated with the longest lasting severe hypoxic events (9.56 h). The environmental variables and combinations of conditions that modulate or augment diel-cycling hypoxia presented in this paper enhance understanding of this widespread and growing phenomenon and provide additional insight regarding the extent to which it can impact food webs in very shallow estuarine waters that often serve as nursery habitat.

AB Hypoxia or deficient oxygen supply to tissues characterize a serie of pathological situations, included cancer. Hypoxic environment activates a signaling cascade that induces or represses the transcription of a multitute of genes involved in angiogenesis, metastasis, glucose metabolism and cell surviving. The responsible of the hypoxia-induced transcriptional response is the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), an heterodimeric transcription factor, consisting of an oxygen-sensitive alpha subunit (HIF-alpha), and a constitutive beta subunit (HIF-beta), that facilitate both oxygen deprivation. HIF pathway is a positive regulator of tumor growth as its inhibition often results in tumor suppression. In clinical tumor samples, HIF is found elevated and correlates with poor patient prognosis in a variety of cancers. The identification of novel molecules targets for cancer therapy, has led to a shift in drug development, with more emphasis on small molecules that can efficiently inhibit the signaling pathways deregulated in cancer.

AB Hypoxia is a common hallmark of healthy tissues in physiological states or chronically inflamed tissues in pathological states. Mammalian cells sense and adapt to hypoxia mainly through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling. Many studies have shown that hypoxia and HIF signaling play an important regulatory role in development and function of innate immune cells and T cells, but their role in B cell biology is still controversial. B cells experience a complex life cycle (including hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B cells, pre-B cells, immature B cells, mature naive B cells, activated B cells, plasma cells, and memory B cells), and the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in the corresponding developmental niche of stage-specific B cells is highly dynamic, which suggests that hypoxia and HIF signaling may play an indispensable role in B cell biology. Based on the fact that hypoxia niches exist in the B cell life cycle, this review focuses on recent discoveries about how hypoxia and HIF signaling regulate the development, metabolism, and function of B cells, to facilitate a deep understanding of the role of hypoxia in B cell-mediated adaptive immunity and to provide novel strategies for vaccine adjuvant research and the treatment of immunity-related or infectious diseases.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the changes in human cerebrovascular function associated with intermittent poikilocapnic hypoxia (IH). Healthy men (n = 8; 24 +/- 1 years) were exposed to IH for 10 days (12% O-2 for 5 min followed by 5 min of normoxia for 1 h). During the hypoxic exposures, oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO(2)) was 85% and the end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 was permitted to fall as a result of hypoxic hyperventilation. Pre- and post-IH intervention subjects underwent a progressive isocapnic hypoxic test where ventilation, blood pressure, heart rate, and cerebral blood flow velocity (middle cerebral artery, transcranial Doppler) were measured to determine the ventilatory, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular sensitivities to isocapnic hypoxia. When compared to the pre-IH trial, cerebrovascular sensitivity to hypoxia significantly decreased (pre-IH = 0.28 +/- 0.15; post-IH = 0.16 +/- 0.14cm s(-1) %SaO(2)(-1); P <0.05). No changes in ventilatory, blood pressure or heart rate sensitivity were observed (P > 0.05). We have previously shown that the ability to oxygenate cerebral tissue measured using spatially resolved near infrared spectroscopy is significantly reduced following IH in healthy humans. Our collective findings indicate that intermittent hypoxia can blunt cerebrovascular regulation. Thus, it appears that intermittent hypoxia has direct cerebrovascular effects that can occur in the absence of changes to the ventilatory and neurovascular control systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Rapid proliferation of tumour results in production of pro-angiogenic factors due to tissue hypoxia. However, the new abnormal blood supply cannot provide correct oxygenation, so low oxygen tension remains, causing resistance to radio-/chemotherapy and increasing the risk of metastases. There are known substances, hypoxia markers, whose level significantly increases in oxygen deficiency. They are: HIF-1 alpha (hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha), CA9 (carboanhydrase 9) and GLUT1 (glucose transporter 1). It is proved that among patients at the same stage of cervical cancer, women with high hypoxia markers' expression have shorter disease-free survival and overall survival time. Many attempts have been made to use hypoxia in target therapy by introducing modified radio/chemotherapy schemes, 20 antibodies, which block VEGF, YC-1 inactivating HIF-1 alpha and bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor responsible for blocking angiogenesis and apoptosis promotion. It is believed that routine examination of hypoxia markers may allow in future the planning of treatment adjusted individually to every patient.

AB Seedlings of two Malus species (M. hupehensis and M. toringoides) were hydroponically grown in normoxic and hypoxic nutrient solutions to determine their hypoxia tolerance and adaptation of root anaerobic respiration to hypoxia stress. The growth of both species was inhibited under hypoxia stress. During hypoxia stress, the generation of superoxide anion radical (O-2(center dot-)) and content of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in roots were significantly increased in both species with similar trends, which led to an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) content and relative membrane permeability (RMP). The degree of growth inhibition and the levels of O-2(center dot-), H2O2, MDA and RMP were greater in M. toringoides; than in M. hupehensis. Under hypoxia stress, pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities in roots were increased during the first 12 days of hypoxia stress and then gradually decreased in both species. The contents of acetaldehyde, alcohol and lactate in roots were also increased and showed similar trends as the activities of anaerobic respiration enzymes. The increases in PDC and ADH activities and lactate content in M. hupehensis under hypoxia conditions were greater than those of M. toringoides, but alcohol and acetaldehyde contents showed opposite trends. These data suggest that M. hupehensis is more tolerant of hypoxia and had less damage from oxidative stress than M. toringoides under hypoxia stress. The capability for anaerobic respiration is up-regulated in roots of Malus in response to hypoxia stress to minimize damage, and the higher hypoxia tolerance of M. hupehensis may be partly due to the higher enzyme activity of PDC, ADH and LDH and lower accumulation of acetaldehyde and alcohol.

AB Objectives: Sestrin2 is a stress-inducible protein and play an important role in adapting stress states of cells. This article reviewed the role of Sestrin2 in hypoxia and hypoxia-related diseases to provide new perspectives for future research and new therapeutic targets for hypoxia-related diseases. Methods: A review was conducted through an electronic search of PubMed and Medline databases. Keywords included Sestrin2, ROS, hypoxia, and hypoxia-related disease. Articles from 2008 to 2021 were mostly included and older ones were not excluded. Results: Sestrin2 is upregulated under various stress conditions, especially hypoxia. Under hypoxic condition, Sestrin2 plays a protective role by reducing the generation of ROS through various pathways, such as adenosine monophosphatea-ctivated protein kinase (AMPK) / mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and nuclear factor-E2-related factor2 (Nrf2) pathway. In addition, Sestrin2 is involved in various hypoxia-related diseases, such as cerebral hypoxic disease, myocardial hypoxic disease, hypoxia-related respiratory disease, and diabetes. Discussion: Sestrin2 is involved in various hypoxia-related diseases and maybe a therapeutic target. Furthermore, most studies focus on cerebral and myocardial ischemia reperfusion. More researches on hypoxia-related respiratory diseases, kidney injury, and diabetes are needed in future.

AB Hypoxia, one of the hallmarks of cancer, is caused by an insufficient oxygen supply, mostly due to a chaotic, deficient tumor microcirculation. Apart from a hypoxia-mediated resistance to standard therapies, modulated gene and protein expression, genetic instability and malignant progression, hypoxia also plays a pivotal role in anti-cancer immune responses by (a) reducing survival, cytolytic and migratory activity of effector cells such as CD4+ cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, natural killer-like T cells and natural killer cells, (b) reducing the production and release of effector cytokines, (c) supporting immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and M2 macrophages, (d) increasing the production and release of immunosuppressive cytokines, and (e) inducing the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this minireview, immunosuppressive effects of hypoxia- and HIF-1a-driven traits in cancers are described.

AB Hypoxia, a prevalent characteristic of most solid malignant tumors, contributes to diminished therapeutic responses and more aggressive phenotypes. The term hypoxia has two definitions. One definition would be a physiologic state where the oxygen partial pressure is below the normal physiologic range. For most normal tissues, the normal physiologic range is between 10 and 20 mmHg. Hypoxic regions develop when there is an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand. The impact of hypoxia on cancer therapeutics is significant: hypoxic tissue is 3x less radiosensitive than normoxic tissue, the impaired blood flow found in hypoxic tumor regions influences chemotherapy delivery, and the immune system is dependent on oxygen for functionality. Despite the clinical implications of hypoxia, there is not a universal, ideal method for quantifying hypoxia, particularly cycling hypoxia because of its complexity and heterogeneity across tumor types and individuals. Most standard imaging techniques can be modified and applied to measuring hypoxia and quantifying its effects; however, the benefits and challenges of each imaging modality makes imaging hypoxia case-dependent. In this chapter, a comprehensive overview of the preclinical and clinical methods for quantifying hypoxia is presented along with the advantages and disadvantages of each.

A knowledge of all the factors affecting radiosensitivity is required before the rational testing of hypoxic cell sensitisers can be planned.

AB Estuarine crustaceans are often exposed to low dissolved O-2 (hypoxia) accompanied by elevated CO2 (hypercapnia), which lowers water pH. Acclimatory responses to hypoxia have been widely characterized; responses to hypercapnia in combination with hypoxia (hypercapnic hypoxia) are less well known. Here we used oligonucleotide microarrays to characterize changes in global gene expression in the hepatopancreas of Pacific whiteleg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, exposed to hypoxia or hypercapnic hypoxia for 4 or 24 h, compared with time-matched animals held in air-saturated water (normoxia). Unigenes whose expressions were significantly impacted by treatment and/or time were used to build artificial neural networks (ANNs) to identify genes with the greatest sensitivity in pairwise discriminations between treatments at each time point and between times for each treatment. ANN gene sets that discriminated hypoxia or hypercapnic hypoxia from normoxia shared functions of translation, mitochondrial energetics, and cellular defense. GO terms protein modification/phosphorylation/cellular protein metabolism and RNA processing/apoptosis/cell cycling occurred at highest frequency in discriminating hypercapnic hypoxia from hypoxia at 4 and 24 h, respectively. For 75.4% of the annotated ANN genes, exposure to hypercapnic hypoxia for 24 h reduced or reversed the transcriptional response to hypoxia alone. These results suggest that high CO2/low pH may interfere with transcriptionally based acclimation to hypoxia or elicit physiological or biochemical responses that relieve internal hypoxia. Whether these data reflect resilience or sensitivity of L. vannamei in the face of expanding hypoxic zones and rising levels of atmospheric CO2 may be important to understanding the survival of this and other estuarine species.

AB A close relationship exists between hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and pulmonary hypertension. The present study was carried out to explore if there are temporal alterations in HIF-1alpha levels during prolonged hypoxia and after monocrotaline (MCT) treatment. First, young Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups: control, hypoxia-1, hypoxia-2, hypoxia-3 and hypoxia-4. Hypoxic rats were placed in a closed hypobaric chamber (380 mm Hg) for a 1-week (hypoxia-1), 2-week (hypoxia-2), 3-week (hypoxia-3) or 5-week (hypoxia-4) period. Second, other young Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: control, MCT-1, MCT-2 and MCT-3. MCT-treated rats were injected subcutaneously once with MCT (60 mg/kg) for a 1-week (MCT-1), 2-week (MCT-2) or 3-week (MCT-3) period. Subsequently, pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) and the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus the septum [RV/(LV + S)] were measured, and lungs were obtained for the determination of HIF-1alpha via Western blot analysis. Both hypoxia and MCT induced temporal increases in the Ppa, the ratio RV/(LV + S) and HIF-1alpha levels. A close relationship between the Ppa and HIF-1alpha level was found in both hypoxia-and MCT-treated animals. In addition, the PaO2 level significantly decreased in rats 1-3 weeks after MCT treatment. These results, along with previous data in the literature, suggest that both chronic hypoxia- and MCT-induced lung hypoxia activate an increase in the production of HIF-1alpha, and result in vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension.

AB Fibrogenic progression of chronic liver diseases (CLDs) towards the end-point of cirrhosis is currently regarded, whatever the aetiology, as a dynamic and highly integrated cellular response to chronic liver injury. Liver fibrogenesis (i.e., the process) is sustained by hepatic populations of highly proliferative, pro-fibrogenic and contractile myofibroblast-like cells (MFs) that mainly originate from hepatic stellate cells (HSC) or, to a less extent, from portal fibroblasts or bone marrow-derived cells. As is well known, liver fibrosis (i.e., the result) is accompanied by perpetuation of liver injury, chronic hepatitis and persisting activation of tissue repair mechanisms, leading eventually to excess deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components.
   In this scenario, hypoxic areas represent a very common and major feature of fibrotic and cirrhotic liver during the progression of CLDs. Cells exposed to hypoxia respond by means of heterodimeric hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that translocate into the nucleus and binds to a specific core sequence defined hypoxia-responsive element (HRE), present in the promoter on several genes which are considered as hypoxia-regulated target genes. HIFs transcription factors can activate a complex genetic program designed to sustain several changes necessary to efficiently counteract the decrease in oxygen tension. Accordingly, hypoxia, through up-regulation of angiogenesis, is currently believed to significantly contribute to fibrogenic progression of CLDs, mostly by affecting the pro-fibrogenic and pro-angiogenic behaviour of hepatic MFs. In addition, experimental and clinical evidence generated in the last decade also indicates that angiogenesis and fibrogenesis in CLDs may also be sustained by HIF-dependent but hypoxia-independent mediators.

AB Liver fibrosis is a potentially reversible pathophysiological event, leading to excess deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and taking place as the net result of liver fibrogenesis, a dynamic and highly integrated process occurring during chronic liver injury of any etiology. Liver fibrogenesis and fibrosis, together with chronic inflammatory response, are primarily involved in the progression of chronic liver diseases (CLD). As is well known, a major role in fibrogenesis and fibrosis is played by activated myofibroblasts (MFs), as well as by macrophages and other hepatic cell populations involved in CLD progression. In the present review, we will focus the attention on the emerging pathogenic role of hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and related mediators in the fibrogenic progression of CLD.

AB Hypoxia/reoxygenation is a physiological stress that activates the DNA damage pathway. Significantly, this pathway is initiated during hypoxia, in the absence of detectable DNA damage. Our most recent study determined that during hypoxia, Chk 2 is phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner. In addition to this finding, we found that components of the MRN complex were not required for Chk 2 phosphorylation during hypoxia/reoxygenation. Once activated, Chk 2 initiates a signaling cascade, which induces a cell cycle arrest in the G(2) phase. Loss of the Chk 2-mediated arrest correlated with an increase in sensitivity to hypoxia/reoxygenation. In contrast, loss of a p53-mediated reoxygenation-induced G(1) arrest does not correlate with increased sensitivity to hypoxia/reoxygenation.

AB Hypoxia is a hallmark of the tumor microenvironment and contributes to tumor malignant phenotypes. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a master regulator of intratumoral hypoxia and controls hypoxia-mediated pathological processes in tumors, including angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, epigenetic reprogramming, immune evasion, pH homeostasis, cell migration/invasion, stem cell pluripotency, and therapy resistance. In this book chapter, we reviewed the causes and types of intratumoral hypoxia, hypoxia detection methods, and the oncogenic role of HIF in tumorigenesis and chemo-and radio-therapy resistance.

AB The existence of sex-specific differences in phenotypic traits is widely recognized. Yet they are often ignored in studies looking at the impact of global changes on marine organisms, particularly within the context of combined drivers that are known to elicit complex interactions. We tested sex-specific physiological responses of the cosmopolitan and ecologically important marine copepod Acartia tonsa exposed to combined hypoxia and marine heatwave (MHW) conditions, both of which individually strongly affect marine ectotherms. Females and males were acutely exposed for 5 days to a combination of either control (18 degrees C) or a high temperature mimicking a MHW (25 degrees C), and normoxia (100% O2 sat.) or mild hypoxia (35% O2 sat.). Life-history traits, as well as sex-specific survival and physiological traits, were measured. Females had overall higher thermal tolerance levels and responded differently than males when exposed to the combined global change drivers investigated. Females also showed lower metabolic thermal sensitivity when compared to males. Additionally, the MHW exerted a dominant effect on the traits investigated, causing a lower survival and higher metabolic rate at 25 degrees C. However, egg production rates appeared unaffected by hypoxia and MHW conditions. Our results showed that MHWs could strongly affect copepods' survival, that combined exposure to hypoxia and MHW exerted an interactive effect only on CTmax, and that sex-specific vulnerability to these global change drivers could have major implications for population dynamics. Our results highlight the importance of considering the differences in the responses of females and males to rapid environmental changes to improve the implementation of climate-smart conservation approaches.

AB Hypoxia, a decrease in oxygen levels, is a hallmark of solid tumors. Hypoxic cells are more resistant to killing by ionizing radiation and chemotherapy, are more invasive and metastatic, resistant to apoptosis, and genetically unstable. Over the last two decades, the discovery of Hypoxia Inducible Factors, a family of transcription factors crucially involved in the response of mammalian cells to oxygen deprivation, has led to the identification of a molecular target associated with hypoxia suitable for the development of cancer therapeutics. These features of solid tumors may offer a unique opportunity for selective therapeutic approaches. A number of strategies targeting hypoxia and/or Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIF) have been developed over the last several years and will be described. The exponentially growing interest in therapeutic strategies targeting hypoxia/HIF will undoubtedly generate more active compounds for preclinical and clinical development. A rational development plan aimed to validate target inhibition in preclinical models and early clinical trials is essential for a rapid translation of these agents to the treatment of human cancers.

AB Introduction: Hypoxia can stimulate F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in cultured cells. A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism is required to determine the value of FDG for studying tumour hypoxia.
   Methods: The effect of hypoxia on FDG uptake, and key proteins involved in glucose transport and glycolysis, was studied in MCF7 and MDA231 breast cancer cell lines.
   Results: Hypoxia induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in FDG uptake. The FOG increase was transient, suggesting that FDG uptake is only likely to be increased by acute hypoxia (<24 h). Molecular analysis indicated that hypoxia upregulated glut1 and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, key proteins involved in regulating glucose transport and glycolysis, and that these changes were induced by Hypoxia-Inducible factor 1 (HIF1) upregulation and/or AMP-activated protein kinase activation.
   Conclusions: FDG may provide useful information about the oxygenation status of cells in hypoxic regions where HIF1 upregulation is hypoxia-driven. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Hemochorial placentation is orchestrated through highly regulated temporal and spatial decisions governing the fate of trophoblast stem/progenitor cells. Trophoblast cell acquisition of specializations facilitating invasion and uterine spiral artery remodeling is a labile process, sensitive to the environment, and represents a process that is vulnerable to dysmorphogenesis in pathologic states. Hypoxia is a signal guiding placental development, and molecular mechanisms directing cellular adaptations to low oxygen tension are integral to trophoblast cell differentiation and placentation. Hypoxia can also be used as an experimental tool to investigate regulatory processes controlling hemochorial placentation. These developmental processes are conserved in mouse, rat, and human placentation. Consequently, elements of these developmental events can be modeled and hypotheses tested in trophoblast stem cells and in genetically manipulated rodents. Hypoxia is also a consequence of a failed placenta, yielding pathologies that can adversely affect maternal adjustments to pregnancy, fetal health, and susceptibility to adult disease. The capacity of the placenta for adaptation to environmental challenges highlights the importance of its plasticity in safeguarding a healthy pregnancy. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB When oxygen is lacking the cellular production of some hormones, cytokines and glycolytic enzymes can be dramatically increased by a hypoxia-induced increase in the expression of the respective genes that encode for these proteins. The most progress in understanding how the transcription of genes is increased under hypoxic conditions has been made by studying the hypoxia-inducible expression of the erythropoietin gene. Elucidating the oxygen sensitive enhancer elements of the erythropoietin gene has prompted studies on other oxygen-regulated genes. The transcription-regulating proteins that are induced with hypoxia bind to closely related regulatory DNA sequences that control the expression of the genes for erythropoietin, the vascular endothelial growth factor and a number of glycolytic enzymes. It became evident that the hypoxia-inducible enhancer may be part of a widespread oxygen-sensing mechanism acting in a wide variety of mammalian cells. Comparison with the oxygen sensor system in the bacterium Rhizobium meliloti revealed some similarities with the putative oxygen sensor in mammalian cells. This sensor is thought to respond to hypoxia by inducing the signalling cascade that results in binding of the transcription factors to their respective enhancer elements to induce transcription of the respective gene.

AB Hypoxia has been widely implicated in numerous pathological conditions, including those associated with inflammation and tumorigenesis. A number of recent studies have implicated hypoxia in the control of microvascular damage, the basis for which is not fully understood. In the present study, it was identified that autophagy was induced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) post treatment with hypoxia, and the induction of autophagy by hypoxia was enhanced by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) gene overexpression and inhibited by HIF-1 knockout. Furthermore, the autophagy induced by overexpression of HIF-1 was associated with a reduction of HUVEC cell viability. Therefore, HIF-1 reduced HUVEC cell viability by inducing autophagy. These findings provide evidence of an important link between hypoxia and microvascular damage associated with HIF-1-related autophagy.

AB Purpose: In this systematic review, the existing evidence of available hypoxia-associated molecular response biomarkers in esophageal cancer (EC) patients is summarized and set into the context of the role of hypoxia in the prediction of esophageal cancer, treatment response and treatment outcome.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in Web of Science, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases using the keywords: hypoxia, esophagus, cancer, treatment outcome and treatment response. Eligible publications were independently evaluated by two reviewers. In total, 22 out of 419 records were included for systematic review. The described search strategy was applied weekly, with the last update being performed on April 3rd, 2017.
   Results: In esophageal cancer, several (non-)invasive biomarkers for hypoxia could be identified. Independent prognostic factors for treatment response include HIF-1 alpha, CA IX, GLUT-1 overexpression and elevated uptake of the PET-tracer F-18-fluoroerythronitroimidazole (F-18-FETNIM). Hypoxia-associated molecular responses represents a clinically relevant phenomenon in esophageal cancer and detection of elevated levels of hypoxia-associated biomarkers and tends to be associated with poor treatment outcome (i.e., overall survival, disease-free survival, complete response and local control).
   Conclusion: Evaluation of tumor micro-environmental conditions, such as intratumoral hypoxia, is important to predict treatment outcome and efficacy. Promising non-invasive imaging-techniques have been suggested to assess tumor hypoxia and hypoxia-associated molecular responses. However, extensive validation in EC is lacking. Hypoxia-associated markers that are independent prognostic factors could potentially provide targets for novel treatment strategies to improve treatment outcome. For personalized hypoxia-guided treatment, safe and reliable makers for tumor hypoxia are needed to select suitable patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Severe hypoxia can induce a range of systemic disorders; however, surprising resilience can be obtained through sublethal adaptation to hypoxia, a process termed as hypoxic conditioning. A particular form of this strategy, known as intermittent hypoxia conditioning hormesis, alternates exposure to hypoxic and normoxic conditions, facilitating adaptation to reduced oxygen availability. This technique, originally employed in sports and high-altitude medicine, has shown promise in multiple pathologies when applied with calibrated mild to moderate hypoxia and appropriate hypoxic cycles. Recent studies have extensively investigated the protective role of intermittent hypoxia conditioning and its underlying mechanisms using animal models, demonstrating its potential in organ protection. This involves a range of processes such as reduction of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, along with enhancement of hypoxic gene expression, among others.Given that intermittent hypoxia conditioning fosters beneficial physiological responses across multiple organs and systems, this review presents a comprehensive analysis of existing studies on intermittent hypoxia and its potential advantages in various organs. It aims to draw attention to the possibility of clinically applying intermittent hypoxia conditioning as a multi-organ protective strategy. This review comprehensively discusses the protective effects of intermittent hypoxia across multiple systems, outlines potential procedures for implementing intermittent hypoxia, and provides a brief overview of the potential protective mechanisms of intermittent hypoxia.

AB In young adults the ventilatory response to 25 min of isocapnic hypoxia (SaO2 = 80%) is characterized by an initial increase in ventilation followed by a decline.  The increase and decline are proportional.  Because older adults have been reported to have reduced initial ventilatory responses to hypoxia, we compared responses to hypoxia in 14 older (mean age 62) and 15 younger (mean age 29) subjects.  There was no difference.  Both groups demonstrated a similar initial increase in ventilation with hypoxia and a similar subsequent decline due to a decline in tidal volume.  In both groups the size of the initial increase was proportional to the subsequent decline.  In both groups hyperoxia immediately after 25 min of hypoxia transiently depressed ventilation, while hyperoxia after room air breathing did not.  We conclude that the ventilatory response to 25 min of hypoxia is independent of age in normal humans.

AB The resistance of rats to hypoxia was measured by survival time after exposure to high-altitude (11.5 km) hypoxia. The first exposure to acute hypoxia caused phasic changes in the survival time: short-term in high-resistant rats (about 24 h) and long-term in moderate- and low-resistant rats (38-39 days) starting from 1 h and 6-7 days after the first exposure, respectively. Adaptive reactions were more pronounced in low- and moderate-resistant rats, while disadaptation was typical of high-resistant animals. In all rats, the adaptive effect dominated until days 22-23. Throughout the testing, the initial type of resistance was retained in 79% of high-resistant rats, in 41% of low-resistant and in 33% of moderate-resistant rats, i.e., the initially homogenous groups formed after the first exposure in accordance with the type of resistance became mixed, which reduced the intergroup differences.

AB Fetal hearts show a remarkable ability to develop under hypoxic conditions. The metabolic flexibility of fetal hearts allows sustained development under low oxygen conditions. In fact, hypoxia is critical for proper myocardial formation. Particularly, hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor play central roles in hypoxia-dependent signaling in fetal heart formation, impacting embryonic outflow track remodeling and coronary vessel growth. Although HIF is not the only gene involved in adaptation to hypoxia, its role places it as a central figure in orchestrating events needed for adaptation to hypoxic stress. Although "normal" hypoxia (lower oxygen tension in the fetus as compared with the adult) is essential in heart formation, further abnormal hypoxia in utero adversely affects cardiogenesis. Prenatal hypoxia alters myocardial structure and causes a decline in cardiac performance. Not only are the effects of hypoxia apparent during the perinatal period, but prolonged hypoxia in utero also causes fetal programming of abnormality in the heart's development. The altered expression pattern of cardioprotective genes such as protein kinase c epsilon, heat shock protein 70, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, likely predisposes the developing heart to increased vulnerability to ischemia and reperfusion injury later in life. The events underlying the long-term changes in gene expression are not clear, but likely involve variation in epigenetic regulation.

AB Dedicated to the memory of Professor Britton Chance on the occasion of his 100th birthday (July 24th, 2013), and remembering many exciting discussions on the oxygenation of breast cancer, on tumor hypoxia in general and imaging of the oxygenation status of malignant tumors.
   Hypoxic tissue subvolumes are a hallmark feature of solid malignant tumors, relevant for cancer therapy and patient outcome because they increase both the intrinsic aggressiveness of tumor cells and their resistance to several commonly used anticancer strategies. Pathogenetic mechanisms leading to hypoxia are diverse, may coexist within the same tumor and are commonly grouped according to the duration of their effects. Chronic hypoxia is mainly caused by diffusion limitations resulting from enlarged intercapillary distances and adverse diffusion geometries and - to a lesser extent - by hypoxemia, compromised perfusion or long-lasting microregional flow stops. Conversely, acute hypoxia preferentially results from transient disruptions in perfusion. While each of these features of the tumor microenvironment can contribute to a critical reduction of oxygen availability, the delivery of imaging agents (as well as nutrients and anticancer agents) may be compromised or remain unaffected. Thus, a critical appraisal of the effects of the various mechanisms leading to hypoxia with regard to the blood-borne delivery of imaging agents is necessary to judge their ability to correctly represent the hypoxic phenotype of solid malignancies.

AB Muscular dystrophies (MDs) are a group of inherited degenerative muscle disorders characterized by a progressive skeletal muscle wasting. Respiratory impairments and subsequent hypoxemia are encountered in a significant subgroup of patients in almost all MD forms. In response to hypoxic stress, compensatory mechanisms are activated especially through Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha). In healthy muscle, hypoxia and HIF-1 alpha activation are known to affect oxidative stress balance and metabolism. Recent evidence has also highlighted HIF-1 alpha as a regulator of myogenesis and satellite cell function. However, the impact of HIF-1 alpha pathway modifications in MDs remains to be investigated. Multifactorial pathological mechanisms could lead to HIF-1 alpha activation in patient skeletal muscles. In addition to the genetic defect per se, respiratory failure or blood vessel alterations could modify hypoxia response pathways. Here, we will discuss the current knowledge about the hypoxia response pathway alterations in MDs and address whether such changes could influence MD pathophysiology.

AB Hypoxia is a common feature of many solid tumors and contributes to their progression. Hypoxic cells in the tumor are not only involved in therapeutic resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy but are also relevant to tumor angiogenesis. To identify novel hypoxia-selective cytotoxins, we screened 20000 cultured broths of microorganisms and found that rakicidin A showed significant hypoxia-selective cytotoxicity. Rakicidin A was approximately 17.5-fold more cytotoxic under hypoxic than under normoxic conditions. CoCl, and antioxidants had no effect on the rakicidin A cytotoxicity under normoxic conditions and rakicidin A did not show the inhibitory effects on HIF-1 transcriptional activity under hypoxic conditions. Thus, although the action mechanism of the bypoxia-selective cytotoxicity of rakicidin A was unknown, our screening study suggested that rakicidin A acts as an antitumor agent for selective therapy against solid tumors.

AB Purpose of reviewHypoxia triggers various cellular processes, both in physiological and pathological conditions, and has recently also been implicated in atherosclerosis. This review summarizes the recent evidence for the presence and the role of hypoxia in atherosclerosis. Additionally, it will elucidate on hypoxic signaling, which is interlinked with inflammatory signaling, and discuss recent advances in imaging of hypoxia in atherosclerosis.Recent findingsHypoxia is present in atherosclerotic plaques in humans and animal models, and systemic hypoxia promotes atherosclerosis. Hypoxia stimulates proatherosclerotic processes, like deficient lipid efflux, inflammation, interference with macrophage polarization and glucose metabolism. However, the molecular mechanism of hypoxia-mediated atherogenesis remains unclear.Noninvasive imaging directly targeting plaque hypoxia has been applied in animal models of atherosclerosis, but remains to be validated in humans. Meanwhile, the metabolic marker F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose, used to detect human atherosclerosis in vivo, may serve as an indirect marker of plaque hypoxia due to enhanced glucose uptake in anaerobic metabolism.SummaryRecent studies underscore the proatherogenic role of hypoxia in macrophage lipid and glucose metabolism, inflammation and polarization. These studies provide new insights into the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and unravel novel therapeutic targets and new options for noninvasive imaging of human atherosclerotic plaques.

AB The synthesis of proteins expressed in human NHIK 3025 cells following exposure to extremely hypoxic conditions (< 4 ppm O2) has been studied. Populations of cells, either in exponential growth or synchronized by the method of detaching mitotic cells, were exposed to extremely hypoxic conditions for up to 20 h. The rate of total protein synthesis was measured at various time points after reoxygenation, and it appeared to be relatively constant and similar to the control level. The protein expression in cells was studied by pulse labelling for 1 h with [S-35]-methionine, and subsequently visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Six proteins appeared to have a changed expression after exposure to extreme hypoxia as compared to control cells; four of them (45, 80. 100 and 150 kD) showed increased, while two (46 and 90 kD) showed decreased expression. The response of these proteins to extreme hypoxia seems to be relatively slow, i.e. with half-times of several hours. Since extreme hypoxia influences cell cycle progression by instantaneous blockage at the G1/S border as well as halting DNA synthesis in S cells, these proteins can hardly cause these effects. Neither is the altered expression of these proteins due to the accumulation of G1 cells caused by hypoxia.

AB Hypoxia-specific cytotoxins have long exhibited considerable promise for treating hypoxic tumors, however recent negative results in large scale clinical trials have highlighted the importance of selecting patients who are most likely to respond using hypoxia imaging methods. This review looks at the available hypoxia-specific cytotoxins and describes how existing hypoxia imaging methods can be best used to predict which tumors will respond. It then surveys prior studies which combine hypoxia-selective cytotoxin treatment with hypoxia imaging, and finally concludes with a discussion of what lessons can be learnt from previous experiences in order to improve the use of these cytotoxic agents in future clinical evaluations.

AB Hypoxia is a condition during which the body or specific tissues are deprived of oxygen. This phenomenon can occur in response to exposure to hypoxic environmental conditions such as high-altitude, or because of pathophysiological conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea. Circumstances such as these can restrict supply or increase consumption of oxygen, leading to oxyhemoglobin desaturation and tissue hypoxia. In certain cases, hypoxia may lead to severe health consequences such as an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. A potential explanation for the link between hypoxia and an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases lies in the disturbing effect of hypoxia on circulating blood lipids, specifically its capacity to increase plasma triglyceride concentrations. Increased circulating triglyceride levels result from the production of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, such as very-low-density lipoproteins and chylomicrons, exceeding their clearance rate. Considerable research in murine models reports that hypoxia may have detrimental effects on several aspects of triglyceride metabolism. However, in humans, the mechanisms underlying the disturbing effect of hypoxia on triglyceride levels remain unclear. In this mini-review, we outline the available evidence on the physiological responses to hypoxia and their impact on circulating triglyceride levels. We also discuss mechanisms by which hypoxia affects various organs involved in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. This information will benefit scientists and clinicians interested in the mechanistic of the regulatory cascade responsible for the response to hypoxia and how this response could lead to a deteriorated lipid profile and an increased risk of developing hypoxia-related health consequences.

AB Hypoxia is a common feature of malignant tumors. There is an interactive connection between hypoxia and chemoresistance, radioresistance, invasiveness, and angiogenesis. Therefore, tumor hypoxia has been considered as a validated target for treating cancer. This review focuses on the role of hypoxia on chemoresistance and radioresistance. In addition, we address several approaches targeting tumor hypoxia, known as hypoxia-targeted therapy.

AB Neurons vary widely in shape, size, type of neurotransmitters and number of synapses. Their common characteristic is a very high sensitivity to changes in oxygen concentration. The consequence of hypoxia is to launch a series of biochemical reactions called the ischemic cascade. The term is a bit misleading, because it suggests that there is a succession of events, in a linear fashion. In fact, the ischemic cascade involves very complex processes that take place simultaneously and interact with each other. The key role in neuronal responses to hypoxia is played by changes related to mitochondria, which occur immediately after hypoxia, at the beginning of the ischemic cascade. Disturbances in the mitochondrial functions are recognized as an essential element not only in acute but also in chronic hypoxia, as well as neurodegenerative diseases.

   Objective: This review summarizes recent evidence from genetic and biological studies showing that hypoxia and hypoxia-related pathways play critical roles in the development and progress of renal cancer.
   Evidence acquisition: We used a systematic search for articles using the keywords hypoxia, HIF, renal cancer, and VHL.
   Evidence synthesis: Identification of the tumor suppressor pVHL has allowed the characterization of important ccRCC-associated pathways. pVHL targets alpha-subunits of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF) for proteasomal degradation. The two main HIF-alpha isoforms have opposing effects on RCC biology, possibly through distinct interactions with additional oncogenes. Furthermore, HIF-1 alpha activity is commonly diminished by chromosomal deletion in ccRCCs, and increased HIF-1 activity reduces tumor burden in xenograft tumor models. Conversely, polymorphisms at the HIF-2 alpha gene locus predispose to the development of ccRCCs, and HIF-2 alpha promotes tumor growth. Genetic studies have revealed a prominent role for chromatin-modifying enzyme genes in ccRCC, and these may further modulate specific aspects of the HIF response. This suggests that, rather than global activation of HIF, specific components of the response are important in promoting kidney cancer. Some of these processes are already targets for current therapeutic strategies, and further dissection of this pathway might yield novel methods of treating RCC.
   Conclusions: In contrast to many tumor types, HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha have opposing effects in ccRCC biology, with HIF-1 alpha acting as a tumor suppressor and HIF-2 alpha acting as an oncogene. The overall effect of VHL inactivation will depend on fine-tuning of the HIF response.
   Patient summary: High levels of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF) are particularly important in the clear cell type of kidney cancer, in which they are no longer properly regulated by the von Hippel-Lindau protein. The two HIF-alpha proteins have opposing effects on tumor evolution. (C) 2015 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant and aggressive primary brain tumor in humans, with a uniformly poor prognosis. Hypoxia is a predominant feature in GBM and its microenvironment; it is associated with the tumor growth, progression and resistance to conventional therapy of cancers. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are the master regulators of the transcriptional response to hypoxia in tumor cells and their microenvironment Numerous studies indicated that hypoxia and HIFs played pivotal roles in the initiation, progression, therapy resistance and recurrence of GBM and maintained the phenotype of glioma stem cells (GSCs), which makes the prognosis of GBM patients worse. This review summarized the current research advance of hypoxia and HIFs in GBM progression and therapeutic implications, which will provide a better understanding of the contribution of hypoxia and HIFs to GBM initiation and progression and highlight that HIFs might be taken as the attractive molecular target approaches for GBM therapeutics.

AB Hypoxia (i.e., low oxygen levels) is a known feature of aggressive tumors. Cells, including tumor cells, respond to conditions of insufficient oxygen by activating a transcriptional program mainly driven by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF)-1 and HIF-2. Both HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha expression levels have been shown to correlate to patient outcome in various tumor forms and in neuroblastoma, a solid childhood tumor of the sympathetic nervous system, in particular, HIF-2 alpha marks a subpopulation of immature neural crest-like perivascularly located cells and associates with aggressive disease and distant metastasis. It has for long been recognized that the HIF-alpha subunits are oxygen-dependently regulated at the post-translational level, via ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Evidence of oxygen-independent mechanisms of regulation, transcriptional control of EPAS1/HIF2A and possible cytoplasmic activities of HIF-2 alpha has also emerged during recent years. In this review, we discuss these non-conventional actions of HIF-2 alpha, its putative role as a therapeutic target and the constraints it carries, as well as the importance of HIF-2 activity in a vascularized setting, the so-called pseudo-hypoxic state.

AB Estuarine waters are prone to regular bouts of low oxygen (hypoxia) and high carbon dioxide (hypercapnia). In vertebrates, tissue hypoxia followed by reoxygenation can generate high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that exceed cellular antioxidant capacity, leading to tissue damage. Here we quantified the expression of several antioxidant genes in the hepatopancreas of Pacific whiteleg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, after exposure to hypoxia or hypercapnic hypoxia for 4 h or 24 h followed by recovery in air-saturated water (normoxia) for 0, 1, 6 or 24 h, as compared to time-matched controls maintained only in normoxia. Transcripts of cytoplasmic Mn-superoxide dismutase (cMnSOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and peptide-methionine (R)-S-oxide reductase (MsrB) increased after 4 h exposure to either hypoxia or hypercapnic hypoxia; these elevated transcript levels persisted longer in animals recovering from hypercapnic hypoxia than hypoxia alone. cMnSOD transcripts generally increased, but GPX, MsrB, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and thioredoxin 1 (TRX-1) decreased or did not change in most long-term (24 h) treatment-recovery groups. Thus, the transcriptional responses of several antioxidant genes during recovery from tidally-driven hypoxia and hypercapnic hypoxia decrease or are muted by more persistent exposure to these conditions, leaving L vannamei potentially vulnerable to ROS damage during recovery.

AB The Richalet hypoxia sensitivity test (RT), which quantifies the cardiorespiratory response to acute hypoxia during exercise at an intensity corresponding to a heart rate of similar to 130 bpm in normoxia, can predict susceptibility of altitude sickness. Its ability to predict exercise performance in hypoxia is unknown.
   Investigate: (1) whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral tissue oxygenation (O(2)Hb; oxygenated hemoglobin, HHb; deoxygenated hemoglobin) responses during RT predict time-trial cycling (TT) performance in severe hypoxia; (2) if subjects with blunted cardiorespiratory responses during RT show greater impairment of TT performance in severe hypoxia.
   Thirteen men [27 +/- A 7 years (mean +/- A SD), Wmax: 385 +/- A 30 W] were evaluated with RT and the results related to two 15 km TT, in normoxia and severe hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.11).
   During RT, mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv: index of CBF) was unaltered with hypoxia at rest (p > 0.05), while it was increased during normoxic (+22 +/- A 12 %, p < 0.05) and hypoxic exercise (+33 +/- A 17 %, p < 0.05). Resting hypoxia lowered cerebral O(2)Hb by 2.2 +/- A 1.2 mu mol (p < 0.05 vs. resting normoxia); hypoxic exercise further lowered it to -7.6 +/- A 3.1 mu mol below baseline (p < 0.05). Cerebral HHb, increased by 3.5 +/- A 1.8 mu mol in resting hypoxia (p < 0.05), and further to 8.5 +/- A 2.9 mu mol in hypoxic exercise (p < 0.05). Changes in CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation during RT did not correlate with TT performance loss (R = 0.4, p > 0.05 and R = 0.5, p > 0.05, respectively), while tissue oxygenation and SaO(2) changes during TT did (R = -0.76, p < 0.05). Significant correlations were observed between SaO(2), MCAv and HHb during RT (R = -0.77, -0.76 and 0.84 respectively, p < 0.05 in all cases).
   CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation changes during RT do not predict performance impairment in hypoxia. Since the changes in SaO(2) and brain HHb during the TT correlated with performance impairment, the hypothesis that brain oxygenation plays a limiting role for global exercise in conditions of severe hypoxia remains to be tested further.

AB Because of the abnormal vasculature, most growing solid tumors contain regions that experience either acute or chronic hypoxia. However, tumor cells can maintain a high glycolytic rate even when there is enough oxygen supply. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play crucial role in the response of tumor cells to this distinct microenvironment by shifting energy production from mitochondria towards glycolysis. In this review, we focus on the metabolism of tumor cell survival in hypoxic microenvironments. Furthermore, we also emphasize the mechanisms by which hypoxia and HIFs regulate tumor metabolism.

AB Exposure to moderate hypoxia alone does not cause neuronal death as long as blood pressure and cerebral blood flow are maintained in mammals. In neonatal and adult mammals including rats and mice, carotid occlusion in combination with hypoxia produces neuronal death and brain infarction. However, preexposure to 8% oxygen for 3 h protects the brain and likely other organs of neonatal and adult rats against combined hypoxia-ischemia 24 h later. In this paper, the possible mechanisms of this so-called hypoxia-induced tolerance to ischemia is discussed. One mechanism likely involves hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha). HIF-1 alpha is a transcription factor that - during hypoxia - binds with a second protein (HIF-1 beta) in the nucleus to promoter elements in hypoxia-responsive target genes. This causes upregulation of HIF target genes including VEGF, erythropoietin, iNOS, glucose transporter-1, glycolytic enzymes, and many other genes to protect the brain against ischemia 24 h later. In addition, non-HIF pathways including MTF-1, Egr-1 and others act directly or indirectly on other target genes to also promote hypoxia-induced preconditioning. Hypoxia preconditioning can be mimicked by iron chelators like desferrioxamine and transition metals like cobalt chloride that inhibit prolyl hydroxylases, increase HIF-1 alpha levels in the brain, and produce protection of the brain against combined hypoxia-ischemia 24 h later. This hypoxia preconditioning has potential clinical usefulness in protecting high-risk newborns or to provide protection prior to surgery. Copyright (c) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Sufficient oxygen supply is crucial for the development and physiology of mammalian cells and tissues. When simple diffusion of oxygen becomes inadequate to provide the necessary flow of substrate, evolution has provided cells with tools to detect and respond to hypoxia by upregulating the expression of specific genes, which allows an adaptation to hypoxia-induced stress conditions. The modulation of cell signaling by hypoxia is an emerging area of research that provides insight into the orchestration of cell adaptation to a changing environment. Cell signaling and adaptation processes are often accompanied by rapid and/or chronic remodeling of membrane lipids by activated lipases. This review highlights the bi-directional relation between hypoxia and lipid signaling mechanisms.

AB Recent studies emphasize the role of chronic hypoxia in the kidney as a final common pathway to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hypoxia of tubular cells leads to apoptosis or epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation. This in turn exacerbates fibrosis of the kidney with loss of peritubular capillaries and subsequent chronic hypoxia, setting in train a vicious cycle whose end point is ESRD. To support this notion, our studies utilizing various techniques such as hypoxia-sensing transgenic rats revealed hypoxia of the kidney in various disease models.
   While fibrotic kidneys with advanced renal disease are devoid of peritubular capillary blood supply and oxygenation to the corresponding region, imbalances in vasoactive substances and associated intrarenal vasoconstriction can cause chronic hypoxia even at the early phase of kidney disease. Among various vasoactive substances, local activation of RAS is especially important because it can lead to constriction of efferent arterioles, hypoperfusion of postglomerular peritubular capillaries, and subsequent hypoxia of the tubulointerstitium in the downstream compartment. Recent studies using BOLD-MRI showed an immediate decrease of oxygen tension in the kidney after angiotensin II infusion. In addition, angiotensin II induces oxidative stress via activation of NADPH oxidase. Oxidative stress damages endothelial cells directly, causing the loss of peritubular capillaries. Oxidative stress also results in relative hypoxia due to inefficient cellular respiration. Thus, angiotensin II induces renal hypoxia via both hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic mechanisms.
   While the beneficial effects of blockade of RAS in kidney disease are, at least in part, mediated by amelioration of hypoxia, recent studies have also elucidated the mechanism of hypoxia-induced gene regulation via the HIF-HRE system. This has given hope for the development of novel therapeutic approaches against hypoxia in the kidney.

AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are ideal materials for cell therapy. Research has indicated that hypoxia benefits MSC survival, but little is known about the underlying mechanism. This study aims to uncover potential mechanisms involving hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A) to explain the promoted MSC survival under hypoxia. MSCs were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured under normoxia or hypoxia condition. The overexpression vector or small interfering RNA of Hif1a gene was transfected to MSCs, after which cell viability, apoptosis and expression of HIF1A were analyzed by MTT assay, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR and Western blot. Factors in p53 pathway were detected to reveal the related mechanisms. Results showed that hypoxia elevated MSCs viability and up-regulated HIF1A (P < 0.05) as previously reported. HIF1A overexpression promoted viability (P < 0.01) and suppressed apoptosis (P < 0.001) under normoxia. Correspondingly, HIF1A knockdown inhibited viability (P < 0.05) and promoted apoptosis (P < 0.01) of MSCs under hypoxia. Expression analysis suggested that p53, phosphate-p53 and p21 were repressed by HIF1A overexpression and promoted by HIF1A knockdown, and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) expression had the opposite pattern (P < 0.05). These results suggest that HIF1A may improve viability and suppress apoptosis of MSCs, implying the protective effect of HIF1A on MSC survival under hypoxia. The underlying mechanisms may involve the HIF1A-suppressed p53 pathway. This study helps to explain the mechanism of MSC survival under hypoxia, and facilitates the application of MSCs in cell therapy.

AB Intermittent hypoxia has been implicated in morbidities associated with sleep apnea, and may be a novel cellular signal for inflammation [J. Appl. Physiol. 90 (2001) 1986]. Standard cell culture has two major limitations for studying the effects of steady-state Po-2 and intermittent hypoxia. First, convective mixing in the culture media can be variable, making precise control of cellular Po-2 difficult. Second, diffusion of oxygen through the culture media slows changes in cellular Po-2 after rapid changes in the gas phase Po-2. Our estimates of diffusional transients for standard cell culture suggest significant restrictions in the ability to cycle Po, at frequencies relevant to intermittent hypoxia. We present a novel system for forced convection cell culture with adherent cells inside capillary tubing. Steady state cellular Po-2 is regulated to an accuracy of approximately 1 Torr. The response time for cycling of Po-2 is less than 1.6 sec. This system is ideally suited for studies of intermittent hypoxia in adherent cells. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Short-term intermittent hypoxia leads to sustained sympathetic activation and a small increase in blood pressure in healthy humans. Because obstructive sleep apnea, a condition associated with intermittent hypoxia, is accompanied by elevated sympathetic activity and enhanced sympathetic chemoreflex responses to acute hypoxia, we sought to determine whether intermittent hypoxia also enhances chemoreflex activity in healthy humans. To this end, we measured the responses of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA, peroneal microneurography) to arterial chemoreflex stimulation and deactivation before and following exposure to a paradigm of repetitive hypoxic apnea (20 s/min for 30 min; O-2 saturation nadir 81.4 +/- 0.9%). Compared with baseline, repetitive hypoxic apnea increased MSNA from 113 +/- 11 to 159 +/- 21 units/min (P = 0.001) and mean blood pressure from 92.1 +/- 2.9 to 95.5 +/- 2.9 mmHg (P = 0.01; n = 19). Furthermore, compared with before, following intermittent hypoxia the MSNA (units/min) responses to acute hypoxia [fraction of inspired O-2 (FIO2) 0.1, for 5 min] were enhanced (pre- vs. post-intermittent hypoxia: +16 +/- 4 vs. +49 +/- 10%; P = 0.02; n = 11), whereas the responses to hyperoxia (FIO2 0.5, for 5 min) were not changed significantly (P = NS; n = 8). Thus 30 min of intermittent hypoxia is capable of increasing sympathetic activity and sensitizing the sympathetic reflex responses to hypoxia in normal humans. Enhanced sympathetic chemoreflex activity induced by intermittent hypoxia may contribute to altered neurocirculatory control and adverse cardiovascular consequences in sleep apnea.

AB Vascularization and vascular remodeling represent critical adaptive responses to tissue hypoxia that are mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). In patients with peripheral arterial disease, these responses are impaired by aging and diabetes, leading to critical limb ischemia and amputation. Intramuscular injection of an adenovirus encoding a constitutively active form of the HIF-1 alpha subunit (CA5) increases the recovery of blood flow following femoral artery ligation in a mouse model of age-dependent critical limb ischemia. Intradermal injection of a plasmid encoding CA5 promotes healing of cutaneous wounds in a mouse model of diabetes. In cancer, vascularization is required for tumors to grow beyond microscopic size, a process that involves HIF-1-dependent production of angiogenic growth factors. Daily treatment of prostate cancer xenograft-bearing mice with low-dose anthracycline (doxorubicin or daunorubicin) chemotherapy inhibits HIF-1 DNA-binding activity, HIF-1-dependent expression of angiogenic growth factors, mobilization of circulating angiogenic cells, and tumor vascularization, thereby arresting tumor growth.

AB IntroductionThe gastric epithelium experiences intermittent hypoxia due to various physiological and pathological conditions. However, the impact of hypoxia and hypoxia-reoxygenation of gastric epithelial cells (GECs) on Helicobacter pylori-mediated gastric cancer (GC) has never been investigated. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) facilitate H. pylori adhesion onto GECs. We evaluated the effect of hypoxia and hypoxia-reoxygenation on CEACAM6-mediated H. pylori binding, infection, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and GEC proliferation.MethodsHypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1 alpha) and CEACAM6 levels were assessed in various GECs. ROS were measured using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA). Bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify the most prominent stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD)-associated NADPH oxidase (NOX) followed by validation by overexpression/suppression studies and western blotting. GC biopsies were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Hypoxia-exposed, reoxygenated, or control cells were compared for ROS generation and H. pylori infection. MTT assay determined cell proliferation.Results and ConclusionsHypoxia and HIF1 mediated upregulation of CEACAM6 in GECs. CEACAM6 significantly promoted ROS generation by inducing NOX4 in hypoxic GECs. HIF1 alpha, CEACAM6, and NOX4 upregulation was detected in gastritis and GC tissues. H. pylori infection significantly increased in hypoxia-exposed GECs as compared to normoxic GECs. Infection of hypoxia-reoxygenated GECs also resulted in significantly increased CEACAM6 and NOX4-mediated ROS generation compared to normoxic GECs. In addition, adhesion of H. pylori, cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) translocation, and GEC proliferation were significantly enhanced in hypoxia-reoxygenated GECs. Collectively, this study established that hypoxia and hypoxia-reoxygenation of GECs facilitate H. pylori infection and infection-mediated GEC proliferation.

AB "What is the O-2 concentration in a normoxic cell culture incubator?" This and other frequently asked questions in hypoxia research will be answered in this review. Our intention is to give a simple introduction to the physics of gases that would be helpful for newcomers to the field of hypoxia research. We will provide background knowledge about questions often asked, but without straightforward answers. What is O-2 concentration, and what is O-2 partial pressure? What is normoxia, and what is hypoxia? How much O-2 is experienced by a cell residing in a culture dish in vitro vs in a tissue in vivo? By the way, the O-2 concentration in a normoxic incubator is 18.6%, rather than 20.9% or 20%, as commonly stated in research publications. And this is strictly only valid for incubators at sea level.

AB To develop a novel chronic intermittent hypoxia chamber for rat models.
   The intermittent hypoxia chamber included two animal cabins (28 x 20 x 15 cm) and a hypoxia chamber (80 x 80 x 60 cm) between them, as well as the actuating device. Pure nitrogen was fed into the hypoxia chamber continuously in order to keep the low O-2 concentration. Each animal cabin could move in and out of the hypoxia chamber with precise timing function. As a result, the animal cabins could be covered by the hypoxia chamber and got the same low O-2 concentration as in the hypoxia chamber and normal O-2 concentration as out of the hypoxia chamber. Twelve healthy, male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 similar to 250 g) were selected to test the effect of the intermittent hypoxia chamber. The O-2 concentration in the hypoxia chamber was 10 +/- 0.5%, and the cycle time of intermittent hypoxia was 180 s (the hypoxia and normoxic time was 90 s, respectively). The hypoxia chamber ran 8 h per day. The arterial blood gas analysis (ABSA) of rats was conducted when the animal cabin was located inside and outside the hypoxia chamber.
   The chronic intermittent hypoxia chamber ran safely and reliably. The ABSA showed that the lowest PaO2 was 35.75 +/- 4.02 mmHg and the lowest SaO(2) was 68.62 +/- 8.36% when the animal cabin was covered by the hypoxia chamber.
   The chronic intermittent hypoxia chamber designed by us was suitable to establish a chronic intermittent hypoxia model for rats.

AB Insects exhibit a remarkable array of adaptations that allow them to handle more or less severe hypoxia associated with numerous aquatic and terrestrial habitats. We consider these habitats and then discuss physiological, behavioral and morphological mechanisms that facilitate insect life under oxygen deprivation. Actually or potentially hypoxic habitats include aquatic systems, flood-prone soils and burrows, intertidal zones, ice encasement and high altitudes. Some microhabitats, including dung, carrion, mammalian alimentary canals, grain and wood, also are subject to hypoxia. Adaptations to hypoxia include the ability to switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolic pathways (with attendant generation of end products), the ability to drastically attenuate basal metabolic rates, altered behaviors and enlarged tracheal system volumes. Research into the biology of hypoxia seems to be progressing from early observations of the abilities of some insects to withstand exposure to hypoxia or anoxia through studies of organismal mechanisms operating in hypoxia to detailed investigations of cellular and intracellular signaling processes. Our hope is this essay will help crystallize the emergent picture of this area for those interested in contributing to future research. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Insufficient tissue oxygenation, or hypoxia, contributes to tumor aggressiveness and has a profound impact on clinical outcomes in cancer patients. At decreased oxygen tensions, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) 1 and 2 are stabilized and mediate a hypoxic response, primarily by acting as transcription factors. HIFs exert differential effects on tumor growth and affect important cancer hallmarks including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, vascularization/angiogenesis, genetic instability, tumor metabolism, tumor immune responses, and invasion and metastasis. As a consequence, HIFs mediate resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy and are associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. Intriguingly, perivascular tumor cells can also express HIF-2 alpha, thereby forming a "pseudohypoxic" phenotype that further contributes to tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of HIFs in cancer has the potential to improve treatment efficacy. Different strategies to target hypoxic cancer cells and/or HIFs include hypoxia-activated prodrugs and inhibition of HIF dimerization, mRNA or protein expression, DNA binding capacity, and transcriptional activity. Here we review the functions of HIFs in the progression and treatment of malignant solid tumors. We also highlight how HIFs may be targeted to improve the management of patients with therapy-resistant and metastatic cancer. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Uterine leiomyoma is characterized by abundant extracellular matrix and broad avascular areas, both constantly resulting in hypoxia, suggesting some hypoxia-induced response function. Here, we examined whether hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha)- mediated hypoxic response function in uterine leiomyoma. Immunoblotting detected higher basal HIF-1 alpha protein expression in nuclear extracts from uterine leiomyoma tissues than in those from the adjacent myometrium (P = .0011). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of HIF-1 alpha-positive cellular components in both leiomyoma and surrounding myometrial tissues. Hypoxia decreased HIF-1 alpha messenger RNA (mRNA), but increased HIF-1 alpha protein in primary culture leiomyoma smooth muscle cells, and caused translocation of HIF-1 alpha from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Hypoxia upregulated mRNAs of 6 potential HIF-responsive genes (ALDOA, ENO1, LDHA, VEGFA, PFKFB3, and SLC2A1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that hypoxia significantly increased recruitment of HIF-1 alpha binding to putative HIF-responsive elements in the HIF-responsive genes, suggesting that the HIF transcriptional complex initiates hypoxia-induced transcription of HIF-responsive genes. These results demonstrated a HIF-1 alpha-mediated hypoxic response in uterine leiomyoma.

AB ARC-111, a small-molecule topoisomerase I inhibitor, is a potent cytotoxic drug against multiple human cancer cell lines under normoxic conditions (Li et al, Cancer Res 2003; 63:8400-8407). In this study, we explore the potential of ARC-111 as a hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha inhibitor under hypoxic conditions. The transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-la, is an essential regulator of tumorigenesis and an attractive molecular target for cancer therapy. We demonstrate that ARC-111 specifically inhibits hypoxia-induced accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, but not other short half-life proteins in multiple human cancer cell lines. ARC-111 inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha protein synthesis specifically and does not inhibit protein synthesis globally. We demonstrate that inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha accumulation by ARC-111 is independent of proteasomal degradation. In addition, we demonstrate using topoisomerase I-resistant cell lines that topoisomerase I is required for ARC-111-mediated hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha inhibition. Experiments performed with nocodazole indicate that ARC-111 inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha accumulation in a cell-cycle-independent manner. Analysis of AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation reveals that ARC-111 does not exhibit inhibitory effect on the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase AKT mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. It has been previously shown that topotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, can also modulate hypoxia-induced hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha accumulation (Rapisarda et aL, Cancer Res 2003; 64:1475-1482). In addition to inhibiting hypoxia-induced accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, ARC-111 exhibits anti proliferative effects against multiple human cancer cell lines. We demonstrate that topoisomerase I is required for the anti proliferative effects of ARC-111. Anti proliferative effects of ARC-111, however, are oxygen-independent, which is distinguishable from inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha accumulation by ARC-111, which is only observed under hypoxia. The results indicate that inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha accumulation and exhibiting anti proliferation of ARC-111 are through distinct mechanisms of action, which reinforce the potential anticancer effect of ARC-111 on hypoxic tumors.

AB Thrombus formation is increased under conditions of hypoxia in animal models of thrombosis and in human populations, but current therapies for thrombosis do not directly target hypoxia-responsive signaling pathways. The vascular response to hypoxia is controlled primarily by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), whose target genes include several factors that regulate thrombus formation. In this article, we review the HIF-dependent and HIF-independent signaling pathways that regulate thrombus formation under hypoxic conditions. A better understanding of hypoxia-induced thrombus formation could lead to the development of novel prophylactic therapies for thrombosis.

AB Hypoxia is a typical hallmark of various diseases, including cancer, ischemic diseases, and stroke. It is also associated with the disease progression. Therefore, it is critical to develop an effective strategy to target the hypoxic region for diagnosis and treatment. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the development of hypoxia-responsive systems for imaging, sensing and therapy. Two types of hypoxia-sensitive systems, the hypoxia inducible factor-1 based systems and bioreductive molecule based systems, were reviewed with comments on their advantages and limitations. Future opportunities and challenges are also discussed in the end.

AB Hypoxia, a key aspect of the tumor microenvironment, plays a vital role in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metabolism, and the immune response within tumors. These factors collectively promote tumor advancement, aggressiveness, metastasis and result in a poor prognosis. Hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), activated under low oxygen conditions, mediates many of these effects by altering drug target expression, metabolic regulation, and oxygen consumption. These changes promote cancer cell growth and survival. Hypoxic tumor cells develop aggressive traits and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, leading to increased mortality. Targeting hypoxic tumor offers a potential solution to overcome the challenges posed by tumor heterogeneity and can be used in designing diagnostic and therapeutic nanocarriers for various solid cancers. This concept provides an overview of the intricate relationship between hypoxia and the tumor microenvironment, highlighting its potential as a promising tool for cancer therapies. The article explores the development of hypoxia in cancer cells and its role in cancer progression, along with the latest advancements in hypoxia-triggered cancer treatment.

AB The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) controls (in an oxygen-dependent manner) the expression of a large number of genes whose products are involved in the response of cells to hypoxia. HIF is an alpha beta dimer that binds to hypoxia response elements (HREs) in its target genes. Human HIF-alpha has three isoforms, HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha and HIF-3 alpha, of which the roles of HIF-3 alpha are largely unknown, although it is usually regarded as a negative regulator of HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha. The human HIF-3 alpha locus is subject to extensive alternative splicing, leading to at least seven variants. We analyzed here the effects of the long variants and the short variant HIF-3 alpha 4 on the hypoxia response. All these variants were found to interact with HIF-beta, HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha. The long HIF-3 alpha variants were localized in the nucleus in hypoxia, while HIF-3 alpha 4 was cytoplasmic. Interaction of the HIF-3 alpha variants with HIF-1 alpha inhibited the nuclear translocation of both. None of the long HIF-3 alpha variants was capable of efficient induction of an HRE reporter in overexpression experiments, but instead inhibited the transcriptional activation of the reporter by HIF-1 and HIF-2. Unexpectedly, siRNA knock-down of the endogenous HIF-3 alpha variants led to downregulation of certain HIF target genes, while overexpression of individual long HIF-3 alpha variants upregulated certain HIF target genes in a variant and target gene-specific manner under conditions in which HIF-beta was not a limiting factor. These data indicate that the HIF-3 alpha variants may have more versatile and specific roles in the regulation of the hypoxia response than previously anticipated.

ID ACUTE MOUNTAIN-SICKNESS
AB Purpose: Currently, in vitro studies have focused on hypoxia injury in acute mountain sickness (AMS), but little effort has been made to assess the effects of hypobaric hypoxia. AMS is a neurological disorder, and rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells are a model to study neuronal survival and apoptosis. Here, we developed a novel cell culture method that mimics hypobaric hypoxia at high attitude and compared the effects of hypobaric hypoxia and normobaric hypoxia on autophagy and apoptosis of PC12 cells. Methods: PC12 cells were cultured under normal conditions, normobaric hypoxia, and hypobaric hypoxia. Autophagy was observed by transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy. The hypoxia-inducible factor1-alpha (HIF1-alpha), LC3, caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-3 expression levels were determined by Western blot. Results: The cell culture chamber mimicking hypobaric hypoxia at high attitude perfectly maintained the air pressure at 41.1 kPa and the oxygen density at 1% (PO2 around 3.08 mmHg). Hypobaric hypoxic treatment of PC12 cells at 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 hours resulted in an increase in HIF1-alpha and LC3II protein levels, and the ratio of HIF1-alpha/actin and LC3II/actin both peaked at 16 hours (p < 0. 01) when the cell viability was 88.02%. There was a 1.5-fold increase in LC3II expression, a 2-fold increase in LC3B-positive spots, and an increase in autophagosome accumulation at hypobaric hypoxia compared to PC12 cells at normobaric hypoxia for 16 hours (p < 0.001). Interestingly, the promotion of autophagy (coculture with rapamycin or 3-MA) in PC12 cells under normobaric hypoxia reduced cleaved caspase-3 expression (the ratio of cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3 decreased, p < 0.01). However, under hypobaric hypoxia, the promotion of autophagy inversely increased cleaved caspase-3 (the ratio of cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3 increased, p < 0.01), and the inhibition of autophagy (hydroxychloroquine [HCQ] coculture) decreased cleaved caspase-3 (the ratio of cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3 decreased, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Compared with normobaric hypoxia cells, hypobaric hypoxia cells cultured in vitro exhibited increased autophagy and apoptosis.

ID TISSUE HYPOXIA
AB Hypoxia has been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is an important area of research. Hypoxia can exacerbate inflammation via the prolylhydroxylase pathway. Inflammation can also trigger hypoxia by damaging mitochondria and endothelial cells to impair blood flow regulation. We hypothesize that there is a "hypoxia-inflammation cycle" in MS which plays an important role in MS disease progression. Therapies that break this cycle may be an interesting area of exploration for treatment of MS.

AB The word "hypoxia" has recently come to the attention of the general public on two occasions, the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 2019 and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. In the academic environment, hypoxia is a current topic of research in biology, physiology, and medicine: in October 2020, there were more than 150,000 occurrences of "hypoxia" in the PubMed database. However, the first occurrence is dated to 1945, while the interest for the effects of oxygen lack on the living organisms started in the mid-19th century, when scientists explored high altitude regions and mainly used the terms "anoxia" or "anoxemia." I therefore researched online through multiple databases to look for the first appearance of "hypoxia" and related terms "hypoxemia" and "hypoxybiosis" in scientific literature published in English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish. Viault and Jolyet used "Hypohematose" in 1894, but this term has not been used since. Hypoxybiosis first appeared in 1909 in Germany, then hypoxemia in 1923 in Austria, and hypoxia in 1938 in Holland. It was then exported to the United States where it appeared in 1940 in cardiology and anesthesiology. The clinical distinction between anoxia and hypoxia was clearly defined by Carl Wiggers in 1941. Hypoxia (decrease in oxygen), by essence variable in time and in localization in the body, in contrast with anoxia (absence of oxygen), illustrates the concept of homeodynamics that defines a living organism as a complex system in permanent instability, exposed to environmental and internal perturbations.

AB Training in mild to moderate hypoxia (14-17% O-2 in breathing air) and extended resting in moderate hypoxia (9-13% O-2) have been shown to have effects in animals and humans on lipid and glucose metabolism, appetite loss, and, in part, on body weight. The causality for these effects is not yet known in detail, and the available data in humans from high-altitude and low-pressure chamber studies are scarce. New technical developments by German companies in the production of artificial climates with normobaric hypoxic conditions in larger rooms at reasonable energy costs allow now to perform hypoxia weight loss studies in obese humans with stable experimental conditions and protocols with a sham hypoxia control. Thirty-two obese people were recruited for a mild intense training study in normobaric hypoxia (15 vol.% O-2) and normoxia/sham hypoxia (20.1 vol.% O-2). Twenty of these [mean age 47.6 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 33.1, 16 m, 4 f) were willing to follow up on an 8-week, three times per week, 90-min low intense physical exercise in their individual fat burning mode, which has been determined by an exercise testing with spiro-ergometry upfront. The subjects were evenly randomized into a hypoxia and sham hypoxia group. The difference of the two groups in weight loss and changes in HBa1C values were analyzed before and after the training period. No nutritional diet was applied. Subjects in the hypoxia group in mean lost significantly more weight than in the sham hypoxia group (Delta 1.14 kg vs Delta 0.03 kg; p=0.026). This resulted in a tendency to reduce the BMI more in the hypoxia group (p=0.326). In the mean, there was no HbA1C exceeding normal values (mean 5.67 and 5.47%), and the HbA1C stayed basically unchanged after the 8-week training. Mild physical exercise three times per week for 90 min in normobaric hypoxia for 8 weeks led to significantly greater weight loss in obese persons than the exercise in sham hypoxia in this, to our knowledge, first sham hypoxia controlled study.

AB Hypoxia (low O-2) is a ubiquitous feature of solid cancers, arising as a mismatch between cellular O-2 supply and consumption. Hypoxia is associated to metastatic disease and mortality owing to its ability to stimulate the formation of blood (angiogenesis) and lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis), thereby allowing cancer cells to escape the unfavorable tumor microenvironment and disseminate into secondary sites. This review outlines molecular mechanisms by which intratumoral hypoxia regulates the expression of motogenic and mitogenic factors that induce angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, whilst discussing their implications for metastatic cancers.

AB Skeletal muscle is one of the most plastic tissues in the body. Repeated exercise causes several muscle adaptations, among which the development of additional capillaries (angiogenesis) is prominent. Conversely, inactivity and some chronic diseases result in loss of muscle capillaries. Since (endurance) exercise depends on adequate O-2 Supply, it is reasonable to hypothesize that hypoxia occurring within muscle during exercise may provide the stimulus to angiogenesis, However, there are other potential stimuli including physical effects of increased muscle blood flow, or of muscle contraction; release of molecules such as NO that could transcriptionally activate angiogenic growth factors; and perhaps changes in the biochemical milieu of the muscle cell such as acidosis. This brief review will address evidence collected to date mostly at the molecular biological level that does in fact implicate reduced intracellular Po-2 as a major stimulus to the angiogenic process resulting from exercise. In particular, it is shown that VEGF message and protein are increased in muscle with exercise, more so in hypoxia, and that HIF-1alpha correlates with VEGF as would be expected if hypoxia were the major stimulus. In addition, we show that muscle intracellular Po-2 falls to very low levels during exercise (3-4 Torr), providing a degree of hypoxia compatible with a strong role for low Po-2 in angiogenic growth factor response. However, the definitive experiments using acute gene manipulation to establish a cause and effect relationship between hypoxia and muscle angiogenesis remain to be performed.

AB Many vertebrate animals have superior tolerance to environmental hypoxia compared to humans. For example, turtles tolerate an environment of 100% N-2 for several hours, without apparent ill effect. This hypoxia tolerance is not limited to heterotherms, as some species of marine mammals, such as the northern elephant seal, may voluntarily dive for periods of up to 2 hours. Torpid bats exhibit prolonged periods of apnea and passive diffusion of oxygen down their trachea through an open glottis supplies a significant amount of the oxygen uptake. The Ruppell's griffon holds the known avian record of flight at 11,278 m, and other birds regularly migrate at altitudes over 8000m. These animals exhibit diverse adaptations for tolerating their hypoxic environment, many of which are poorly understood. Some of theses strategies include 1) the ability to lower metabolic rate when exposed to hypoxia 2) the ability to recruit alternate biochemical pathways for energy production 3) a left shifted oxy-hemoglobin dissociation curve 4) more efficient pulmonary gas exchange 5) the ability to alter blood flow distribution under hypoxic stress. Although there are common themes of animal adaptation to hypoxic stress, many animal solutions are unique.

AB Bone fracture is accompanied with poor oxygen supply and nutrient deficiency in the local fracture site, and oxygen supply is an important factor that can affect fracture healing. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) plays a key role in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis. HIF-1 alpha is rapidly upregulated in response to hypoxia and antagonizes hypoxia-induced apoptosis. In the present study, the viability of an osteoblast cell line, MC3T3-E1, and the expression of HIF-1 alpha protein in the MC3T3-E1 cells was examined under hypoxic conditions. The HIF-1 alpha level was then manipulated and the reduction in the viability of the MC3T3-E1 cells in response to the hypoxia was re-evaluated. In addition, the regulation of HIF-1 alpha in the adaptation of MC3T3-E1 cells to hypoxia was explored. The results showed that the viability of MC3T3-E1 cells decreased and the expression of HIF-1 alpha protein increased under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, the reduction in the viability of MC3T3-E1 cells post-hypoxia was attenuated by HIF-1 alpha overexpression, while HIF-1 alpha-knockdown by small interfering RNA enhanced the hypoxia-induced decrease in cell viability. It was additionally found that the forced expression of HIF-1 alpha inhibited the hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis. These findings indicate that the forced expression of HIF-1 alpha inhibits hypoxia-induced apoptosis and thus attenuates the hypoxia-induced decrease in cell viability.

AB We have shown previously that human glioblastoma multiforme cells vary in their ability to survive under hypoxic conditions. Under oxygen limiting conditions, hypoxia-to I e rant cells decrease their oxygen consumption rate whereas hypoxia-sensitive cells continue to consume oxygen at a relatively steady rate until the oxygen supply becomes exhausted. We now show that hypoxia-tolerant and hypoxia-sensitive cells exhibit distinct patterns of mitochondrial function in response to hypoxic challenge. Hypoxia-to le rant cell lines retain stable mitochondtrial membrane potential and ATP concentration when incubated under oxygen limiting conditions. In addition, hypoxia-tolerant cell lines are consistently more sensitive to a wide spectrum of inhibitors of mitochondrial function than are hypoxia-sensitive cells. In contrast, the hypoxia-sensitive cells are unable to maintain stable mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels when incubated at reduced oxygen tension. These results demonstrate significant differences in the mitochondrial function between these two phenotypes and reinforce previous data that suggest a regulatory role for mitochondria in the development of hypoxia tolerance.

AB Hypoxia poses many problems to the treatment of cancer. Hypoxic tumors are more resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. In addition, hypoxia induces a number of genes responsible for increased invasion, aggressiveness, and metastasis of tumors. The augmented metastatic potential due to hypoxia-mediated gene expression is discussed in this section. Particular attention is given to recent studies of specific genes involved in the key steps of metastasis, including extracellular matrix interactions, migration, and proliferation.

AB Up to now, the UK has avoided major marine heatwaves (MHWs) that cause severe damage to marine ecosystems and the blue economy. However, an unprecedented in its intensity, though short-lived, MHW occurred in UK waters in June 2023. This event sounded an alarm bell, highlighting gaps in our understanding of MHW characteristics and their potential future impacts in the UK. Here, we use a combination of remote sensing data and model output to characterise MHWs and Marine Cold Spells (MCSs) around the UK and the wider North Atlantic, and to assess the potential for concurrent biogeochemical extreme events. Results indicate that across the wider North Atlantic, the UK is not a hot spot for MHWs or MCSs but, regionally, the southern North Sea experiences the most activity. This is also the location of extreme chlorophyll-a concentrations, here termed blue waves (low chlorophyll-a) and green waves (high chlorophyll-a). However, there is not a very pronounced relationship between temperature and chlorophyll-a extremes, which may be impacted by the exact location, drivers and season of occurrence. In contrast, the southern North Sea and English Channel may experience a MHW and low near-bottom oxygen compound events year-round, which, due to the combination of thermal stress and reduced oxygen availability, may negatively impact benthic marine ecosystems. While MHWs in UK waters do not appear to be as long-lasting or intense as other well-documented events around the world, they are projected to increase. Thus, the UK has a unique opportunity to learn from other nations and so develop robust and comprehensive policies to increase preparedness and response capability for future extreme events.

AB Post-translational modifications (PTMs) to the tails of the core histone proteins are critically involved in epigenetic regulation. Hypoxia affects histone modifications by altering the activities of histone-modifying enzymes and the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) isoforms. Synthetic hypoxia mimetics promote a similar response, but how accurately the hypoxia mimetics replicate the effects of limited oxygen availability on the levels of histone PTMs is uncertain. Here we report studies on the profiling of the global changes to PTMs on intact histones in response to hypoxia/ hypoxia-related stresses using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We demonstrate that intact protein LC-MS profiling is a relatively simple and robust method for investigating potential effects of drugs on histone modifications. The results provide insights into the profiles of PTMs associated with hypoxia and inform on the extent to which hypoxia and hypoxia mimetics cause similar changes to histones. These findings imply chemically-induced hypoxia does not completely replicate the substantial effects of physiological hypoxia on histone PTMs, highlighting that caution should be used in interpreting data from their use.

AB We studied the mechanisms of adaptation of human breast cancer cells MCF-7 to hypoxia and analyzed the role of AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in the maintenance of cell proliferation under hypoxic conditions. It was found that long-term culturing (30 days or more) of MCF-7 cells under hypoxic conditions induced their partial adaptation to hypoxia. Cell adaptation to hypoxia was associated with attenuation of hypoxia-dependent AMPK induction with simultaneous constitutive activation of mTOR and Akt. These findings suggest that these proteins can be promising targets for targeted therapy of tumors developing under hypoxic conditions.

AB Using respirometry, we examined the hypoxia tolerance of 31 teleost fish species (seven families) inhabiting coral reefs at a 2-5 m depth in the lagoon at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia). All fishes studied maintained their rate of oxygen consumption down to relatively severe hypoxia (20-30% air saturation). Indeed, most fishes appeared unaffected by hypoxia until the oxygen level fell below 10% of air saturation. This, hitherto unrecognized, hypoxia tolerance among coral reef fishes could reflect adaptations to nocturnal hypoxia in tide pools. It may also be needed to enable fishes to reside deep within branching coral at night to avoid predation. Widespread hypoxia tolerance in a habitat with such an extreme biodiversity as coral reefs indicate that there is a wealth of hypoxia related adaptations to be discovered in reef fishes.

   1 alpha; hypoxia; cancer; apoptosis
AB The effects of the separate and combined application of hypoxia and antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) against hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A) on cancer cells were examined. Experiments were carried out on human ovarian carcinoma cells in four series: (1) control [Normoxia (5% CO2 in air), no treatment], (2) hypoxia (1% O-2, 5% CO2, and 94% N-2 for 48 h), (3) treatment with ASO targeted to HIF1A (48 h), and (4) combined action of hypoxia and ASO. After treatment, the following processes and factors were monitored: apoptosis, cellular metabolism and viability, expression of genes encoding HIF1A, von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL), and genes responsible for cell death induction and antiapoptotic defense (P53, BCL2, BAX, and caspases 9 and 3). Expression of caspase 9 and HIF1A protein was confirmed by Western blotting. Liposomes were used as a delivery system of HIF1A ASO. It was found that hypoxia alone significantly disturbed cellular metabolism, reducing the level of respiration by 50% when compared with control. Hypoxia induced apoptosis by upregulating the P53-, BAX-, and caspase-dependent cell death pathways, while activating cellular antiapoptotic defense by the overexpression of BCL2 protein. Both opposing effects were dependent on the overexpression of hypoxia inducible factor. We conclude that hypoxia induces a bimodal effect, simultaneously promoting cell death and activating cellular resistance. The downregulation of HIF1A promoted cell death induction and prevented activation of cellular defense by hypoxia. This suggests that HIF1A is a potential candidate for anticancer therapeutic targeting.

AB Obesity per se is rapidly emerging all over the planet and further accounts for many other life-threatening conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. Decreased oxygen supply or increased relative oxygen consumption in the adipose tissue results in adipose tissue hypoxia, which is a hallmark of obesity. This review aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the hypoxia signaling in the adipose tissue. First, we summarize literature evidence to demonstrate that hypoxia is regularly observed during adipose tissue remodeling in humans and rodent models with obesity. Next, we discuss how hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are regulated and how adipose tissues behave in response to hypoxia. Then, the differential roles of adipose HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha in adipose tissue biology and obesity pathology are highlighted. Finally, the review emphasizes the importance of modulating adipose hypoxia as a therapeutic avenue to assist adipose tissues in functionally adapting to hypoxic conditions, ultimately promoting adipose health and improving outcomes due to obesity.

AB Endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) is classically viewed as a regulator of vasomotor tone. NO plays an important role in regulating O-2 delivery through paracrine control of vasomotor tone locally and cardiovascular and respiratory responses centrally. Very soon after the cloning and functional characterization of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), studies on the interaction between O-2 and NO made the paradoxical finding that hypoxia led to decreases in eNOS expression and function. Why would decreases in O-2 content in tissues elicit a loss of a potent endothelial-derived vasodilator? We now know that restricting our view of NO as a regulator of vasomotor tone or blood pressure limited deeper levels of mechanistic insight. Exciting new studies indicate that functional interactions between NO and O-2 exhibit profound complexity and are relevant to diseases states, especially those associated with hypoxia in tissues. NOS isoforms catalytically require O-2. Hypoxia regulates steady-state expression of the mRNA and protein abundance of the NOS enzymes. Animals genetically deficient in NOS isoforms have perturbations in their ability to adapt to changes in O-2 supply or demand. Most interestingly, the intracellular pathways for O-2 sensing that evolved to ensure an appropriate balance of O-2 delivery and utilization intersect with NO signaling networks. Recent studies demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilization and transcriptional activity is achieved through two parallel pathways: (1) a decrease in O-2-dependent prolyl hydroxylation of HIF and (2) S-nitrosylation of HIF pathway components. Recent findings support a role for S-nitrosothiols as hypoxia-mimetics in certain biological and/or disease settings, such as living at high altitude, exposure to small molecules that can bind NO, or anemia.

ID MILD ACUTE HYPOXIA; MENTAL PERFORMANCE; 8,000 FEET; ALTITUDE
AB INTRODUCTION: The effects of low-grade hypoxia on cognitive function are reported in this paper. The study compared cognitive function during short exposures at four different altitudes.
   METHODS: Ninety-one subjects were exposed to simulated altitudes of ground level, 1524, 2438, and 3658 m (5000, 8000, and 12,000 ft) in the Brooks City-Base altitude pressure chamber in a balanced design. Oxygen saturation, heart rate, and cognitive performance on seven different cognitive tasks were measured. In addition, subjects indicated their symptoms from a 33-item subjective symptom survey.
   RESULTS: As designed, oxygen saturation decreased and heart rate increased with higher altitudes. Very small degradations in performance were found at the two highest altitudes for only two of the cognitive tasks (continuous performance and grammatical reasoning). In the subjective symptom survey, 18 of the 33 possible symptoms were more common at 3658 m (12,000 ft) than at ground level.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated a minimal influence of low-grade hypoxia on cognitive performance in contrast to some existing classic symptoms of hypoxia.

AB The chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 plays a role in regulating the lymphocyte and macrophage infiltrate in ovarian cancer, but macrophages also accumulate in necrotic areas of the tumors where there is little MCP-1 expression (Negus, R. P. M. et al., Am. J. Pathol. 1997. 150: 1723-1734). Necrotic regions are likely to be hypoxic. In this study we show that hypoxia inhibits MCP-1-induced migration of THP-1 monocytic cells and human macrophages. In contrast, lymphocytes from peripheral blood migrate normally to an MCP-1 gradient in hypoxic conditions. The inhibition of monocyte migration by hypoxia is rapid and reversible. At the exposure times studied (30-90 min) hypoxia does not affect expression of the MCP-1 receptor CCR2B and cells exposed to hypoxia still respond to MCP-1 with an elevation of intracellular calcium. Although hypoxia is known to modulate gene expression, the inhibition of migration reported here was not due to the production of soluble factors, and mRNA expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor was unchanged. Hypoxia-induced inhibition of chemotaxis was not limited to MCP-1. Hypoxia also inhibited the chemotactic response to macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, RANTES and the chemoattractant N-formyl-met-leu-phe, but hypoxic cells were still able to phagocytose opsonized red blood cells. We suggest that inhibition of migration by hypoxia is not due to gene regulation but is a reflection of metabolic changes in the cell. Transient hypoxia may regulate the distribution of macrophages in tumors and other inflammatory conditions.

AB The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activates transcription via binding to the highly variable hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs). All hypoxia-inducible constructs described to date utilize multimers of naturally occurring HREs. Here, we describe the rational design of minimal hypoxia-inducible enhancers, conceptually equivalent to using an optimized HIF-binding site (HBS) as the building block. Optimizations of the HBS, spacing between HBSs, the distance from the minimal promoter, and orientation of HBSs allowed us to design constructs with high hypoxic activity. Activation of the 4xopt HBS (36 bp) construct by hypoxia or HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha was comparable with that of the 4xEPO HRE (208 bp) construct. The strong synergism between the properly arranged optimized HBSs was due to stimulation of high affinity HIF binding. Our data prove, for the first time, that it is possible to assemble artificial hypoxia-inducible enhancers from a single type of regulatory element-optimized HBS. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Hypoxia plays an important role in the development of solid tumors and is associated with their therapeutic resistance. There exist three major forms of hypoxia: acute, chronic, and intermittent hypoxia. Previous studies have shown that cancer cells could behave in the form of adaptation to hypoxia in tumor growth, which could result in their biological changes and determine their responses to the therapies. To investigate the tumor cells' adaptation to hypoxia, we recreated two models using two lung cancer cell lines in the presence of intermittent hypoxia, which is characterized by changes in oxygen pressure within the disorganized vascular network. We investigated biological behaviors such as cell cycle, proliferation, radiation sensitivity, apoptosis and migration, hypoxia signal pathway in the lung cancer cells treated with chronic intermittent hypoxia, as well as the role of hypoxia inducible factor 1 there, hypoxia-inducible genes analyzed by real-time RT-PCR chip in H446 cells treated with the model. The results indicated the changes of some hypoxia target gene expressions of those induced by hypoxia, some of which were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. The cells mediated by irradiation induced resistance to radiation and apoptosis and increased metastasis in lung cancer cells. It was found that such changes were related to hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit (HIF-1 alpha). J. Cell. Biochem. 111: 554-563, 2010. (c) 2010 Wiley- Liss, Inc.

AB Renal fibrosis is the final stage of most progressive kidney diseases. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with high comorbidity and mortality. Thus, preventing fibrosis and thereby preserving kidney function increases the quality of life and prolongs the survival of patients with CKD. Many processes such as inflammation or metabolic stress modulate the progression of kidney fibrosis. Hypoxia has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis, and oxygen sensing in the kidney is of outstanding importance for the body. The dysregulation of oxygen sensing in the diseased kidney is best exemplified by the loss of stimulation of erythropoietin production from interstitial cells in the fibrotic kidney despite anemia. Furthermore, hypoxia is present in acute or chronic kidney diseases and may affect all cell types present in the kidney including tubular and glomerular cells as well as resident immune cells. Pro- and antifibrotic effects of the transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factors 1 and 2 have been described in a plethora of animal models of acute and chronic kidney diseases, but recent advances in sequencing technologies now allow for novel and deeper insights into the role of hypoxia and its cell type-specific effects on the progression of renal fibrosis, especially in humans. Here, we review existing literature on how hypoxia impacts the development and progression of renal fibrosis.

AB Hypoxia is an inevitable feature of solid tumors and a common cause of treatment failure. Hypoxia acts as a trigger to genetic instability, apoptosis and possibly metastases. The adaptive response to cellular hypoxia involves the modulation of the synthesis of multiple proteins controlling processes such as glucose homeostasis, angiogenesis, vascular permeability and inflammation. The hypoxia responsive element (HRE) sequences isolated from oxygen-responsive genes have been shown to selectively induce gene expression in response to hypoxia when placed upstream of a promoter. The levels of induced gene expression were dependent on the number of HIRE copies and the oxygen tension. Hypoxia-mediated cancer gene therapy strategies may represent a promising mean to significantly improve the efficacy of standard radiation therapy and chemotherapy approaches.

AB Chronic exposure to moderate hypoxia elicits structural and functional changes in the microvascular network of the mammalian CNS. Hypoxia-induced angiogenesis can be elicited and studied by a relatively simple experimental method. Rats or mice can be exposed to mild hypoxia in a hypobaric chamber, or alternatively in a normobaric hypoxia chamber. After 3 weeks, the animals are perfused and fixed, the brain removed, and paraffin embedded and sectioned at 5 mu m. The sections are stained for the blood-brain barrier glucose transporter (GLUT-1) by immunohistochemistry, capillary profiles identified and counted as a measure of angiogenesis.

AB Rationale: Mild hypoxia conditioning induced by repeated episodes of transient ischemia is a clinically applicable method for protecting the brain against injury after hypoxia-ischemic brain damage.
   Objective: To assess the effect of repeated mild hypoxia postconditioning on brain damage and long-term neural functional recovery after hypoxia-ischemic brain damage.
   Methods and results: Rats received different protocols of repeated mild hypoxia postconditioning. Seven-day-old rats with hypoxia ischemic brain damage (HIBD) from the left carotid ligation procedure plus 2 h hypoxic stress (8% O-2 at 37 degrees C) were further receiving repeated mild hypoxia intermittently. The gross anatomy, functional analyses, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) expression, and neuronal apoptosis of the rat brains were subsequently examined. Compared to the HIBD group, rats postconditioned with mild hypoxia had elevated HIF-1 alpha expression, more Nissl-stain positive cells in their brain tissue and their brains functioned better in behavioral analyses. The recovery of the brain function may be directly linked to the inhibitory effect of HIF-1 alpha on neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, there were significantly less neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region of the rats postconditioned with mild hypoxia, which might also be related to the higher HIF-1 alpha expression and better brain performance. Overall, these results suggested that postconditioning of neonatal rats after HIBD with mild hypoxia increased HIF-1 alpha expression, exerted a neuroprotective effect and promoted neural functional recovery.
   Conclusions: Repeated mild hypoxia postconditioning protects neonatal rats with HIBD against brain damage and improves neural functional recovery. Our results may have clinical implications for treating infants with HIBD.

AB This work aims at investigating the effects of hypoxic preconditioning on hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) expression in the hippocampus of mice during acute and repeated hypoxic exposures. The mice were randomly divided into three groups and exposed, respectively, to hypoxia for 4 runs (group H4), 1 run ( group H1), and 0 run ( group H0). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and chromatin immunoprecipitation were used to examine the HIF-1 alpha responses in the mouse hippocampus following exposure to hypoxia. The tolerance of mice to hypoxia increased significantly following acute and repetitive exposure to autoprogressive hypoxia. Total mRNA, total protein, and nuclear protein were extracted from the hippocampus for RT-PCR, Western blot, and EMSA, respectively. The HIF-1 alpha mRNA levels were found to be increased in group H1 and decreased in group H4. The HIF-1 alpha protein levels and HIF-1 DNA-binding activities were increased in group H1 and markedly increased in group H4. One of the HIF-1 target genes, vascular endothelial growth factor, increased in group H4. HIF-1 activation is thought to be involved in the protection of the brain of hypoxic preconditioned mice.

AB Purpose: We sought to determine whether hypoxia-induced radioresistance is mediated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha).
   Methods and Materials: We used 2 mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines transformed with H-ras and TAg, 1 HIF-1 alpha(+/+) and the other HIF-1 alpha(-/-). Cell were exposed to either 95% air and 5% CO2 (normoxic conditions) or 0.2% O-2, 94.8% N-2, and 5% CO2 (hypoxic conditions) for 4 hours. Cells were then irradiated and subjected to clonogenic survival assays.
   Results: Whereas neither +/+ ras/TAg nor -/- ras/TAg cells expressed HIF-1 alpha under normoxic conditions, hypoxia induced expression of HIF-1 alpha only in +/+ ras/TAg cells, confirming the absence of HIF-1 alpha in -/- ras/TAg cells. Clonogenic survival curves for +/+ ras/TAg and -/- ras/TAg cells under normoxia and hypoxia demonstrated that hypoxia increased radioresistance in both cell lines to the same degree. At 1-log cell kill, the +/+ ras/TAg and -/- ras/TAg cells had an identical oxygen enhancement ratio of 1.28 +/- 0.09 and nearly identical oxygen enhancement ratios at 2-log cell kill.
   Conclusion: In our system of transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts, hypoxia-mediated radiation resistance is independent of HIF-1 alpha. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: The development of breast cancer cells is linked to hypoxia. The hypoxia-induced factor HIF-1 alpha influences metastasis through neovascularization. Hypoxia seems to decrease the responsiveness to hormonal treatment due to loss of estrogen receptors (ERs). Obesity is discussed to increase hypoxia in adipocytes, which promotes a favorable environment for tumor cells in mammary fat tissue, whereas, tumor cells profit from good oxygen supply and are influenced by its deprivation as target regions within tumors show. This review gives an overview of the current state on research of hypoxia and breast cancer in human adipose tissue.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed (2000-2016) by applying hypoxia and/or adipocytes and breast cancer as keywords. Review articles were excluded as well as languages other than English or German. There was no restriction regarding the study design or type of breast cancer. A total of 35 papers were found. Eight studies were excluded due to missing at least two of the three keywords. One paper was removed due to Russian language, and one was dismissed due to lack of adherence. Seven papers were identified as reviews. After applying exclusion criteria, 18 articles were eligible for inclusion.
   Results: Two articles describe the impairment of mammary epithelial cell polarization through hypoxic preconditioning. A high amount of adipocytes enhances cancer progression due to the increased expression of HIF-1 alpha which causes the loss of ER a protein as stated in four articles. Four articles analyzed that increased activation of HIF's induces a series of transcriptions resulting in tumor angiogenesis. HIF inhibition, especially when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy, holds strong potential for tumor suppression as stated in further four articles. In two articles there is evidence of a strong connection between hypoxia, oxidative stress and a poor prognosis for breast cancer via HIF regulated pathways. Acute hypoxia seems to normalize the microenvironment in breast cancer tissue and has proven to affect tumor growth positively as covered in two articles.
   Conclusion: This review indicates that the development of breast cancer is influenced by hypoxia. A high amount of adipocytes enhances cancer progression due to the increased expression of HIF-1 alpha.

AB Marine heatwaves (MHWs) and cold-spells (MCSs) are extreme sea surface temperature events with significant impacts on marine ecosystems. However, the connection between these events and mixed layer depth (MLD) variations, as well as how their intensity relates to MLD changes, remains unclear. Integrating OISST V2.1 data with Argo profiles, this analysis finds that during MHWs, MLD decreases by 8.10% globally, while during MCSs, it increases by 8.13%. In 5 degrees x 5 degrees bins, 80.46% of ocean regions show MLD shallowing during MHWs, while 67.69% show deepening during MCSs. A significant global correlation between the intensity of MHWs/MCSs and MLD changes, with coefficients of -0.85 and -0.86, respectively. MHWs are more common in mesoscale anticyclonic eddies (AEs) (19.45%) than in cyclonic eddies (CEs) (10.11%). For MCSs, the pattern reverses, with 8.57% in AEs and 20.82% in CEs. Restratification and mesoscale eddies are two important factors driving MLD changes during these events.

AB Climatic extremes are becoming increasingly common against a background trend of global warming. In the oceans, marine heatwaves (MHWs)-discrete periods of anomalously warm water-have intensified and become more frequent over the past century, impacting the integrity of marine ecosystems globally. We review and synthesize current understanding of MHW impacts at the individual, population, and community levels. We then examine how these impacts affect broader ecosystem services and discuss the current state of research on biological impacts of MHWs. Finally, we explore current and emergent approaches to predicting the occurrence and impacts of future events, along with adaptation and management approaches. With further increases in intensity and frequency projected for coming decades, MHWs are emerging as pervasive stressors to marine ecosystems globally. A deeper mechanistic understanding of their biological impacts is needed to better predict and adapt to increased MHW activity in the Anthropocene.

AB Hypoxia, a common characteristic in solid tumors, is found in phenotypically aggressive cancers that display resistance to typical cancer interventions. Due to its important role in tumor progression, tumor hypoxia has been considered as a primary target for cancer diagnosis and treatment. An advantage of hypoxia-activated nanomedicines is that they are inactive in normoxic cells. In hypoxic tumor tissues and cells, these nanomedicines undergo reduction by activated enzymes (usually through 1 or 2 electron oxidoreductases) to produce cytotoxic substances. In this review, we will focus on approaches to design nanomedicines that take advantage of tumor hypoxia. These approaches include: i) inhibitors of hypoxia-associated signaling pathways; ii) prodrugs activated by hypoxia; iii) nanocarriers responsive to hypoxia, and iv) bacteria mediated hypoxia targeting therapy. These strategies have guided and will continue to guide nanoparticle design in the near future. These strategies have the potential to overcome tumor heterogeneity to improve the efficiency of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and diagnosis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose of review
   It is important to address the factors involved in the progression of atherosclerosis because advanced atherosclerotic lesions are prone to rupture, leading to disability or death. Hypoxic areas are known to be present in human atherosclerotic lesions, and lesion progression is associated with the formation of lipid-loaded macrophages and increased local inflammation. Here we summarize the role of hypoxia in the development of advanced atherosclerotic lesions by promoting lipid accumulation, inflammation, ATP depletion, and angiogenesis.
   Recent findings
   A recent study clearly demonstrated the presence of hypoxia in macrophage-rich regions of advanced human carotid atherosclerotic lesions. We showed that hypoxia increases the formation of lipid droplets in macrophages and promotes increased secretion of inflammatory mediators, and recent evidence indicates that lipid droplets may play a role in mediating the inflammatory response. Hypoxia also promotes lesion progression by exacerbating ATP depletion and lactate accumulation, and the presence of hypoxia in human carotid atherosclerotic lesions correlates with angiogenesis.
   Summary
   Recent studies indicate that hypoxia may play a key role in the progression to advanced lesions by promoting lipid accumulation, increased inflammation, ATP depletion, and angiogenesis. Further understanding of the effects of hypoxia in atherosclerotic lesions could indicate potential therapeutic targets.

AB Hypoxia and warm ischemia are primary concerns in ischemic heart disease and transplant and trauma. Hypoxia impacts tissue ATP supply and can induce mitochondrial dysfunction that elevates reactive species release. The epaulette shark, Hemiscyllum ocellatum, is remarkably tolerant of severe hypoxia at temperatures up to 34 degrees C, and therefore provides a valuable model to study warm hypoxia tolerance. Mitochondrial function was tested in saponin permeabilised ventricle fibres using high-resolution respirometry coupled with purpose-built fluorospectrometers. Ventricular mitochondrial function, stability and reactive species production of the epaulette shark was compared with that of the hypoxia-sensitive shovelnose ray, Aptychotrema rostrata. Fibres were prepared from each species acclimated to normoxic water conditions, or following a 2 h, acute hypoxic exposure at levels representing 40% of each species' critical oxygen tension. Although mitochondrial respiratory fluxes for normoxia-acclimated animals were similar for both species, reactive species production in the epaulette shark was approximately half that of the shovelnose ray under normoxic conditions, even when normalised to tissue oxidative phosphorylation flux. The hypoxia-sensitive shovelnose ray halved oxidative phosphorylation flux and cytochrome c oxidase flux was depressed by 34% following hypoxic stress. In contrast, oxidative phosphorylation flux of the epaulette shark ventricular fibres isolated from acute hypoxia exposed the animals remained similar to those from normoxia-acclimated animals. However, uncoupling of respiration revealed depressed electron transport systems in both species following hypoxia exposure. Overall, the epaulette shark ventricular mitochondria showed greater oxidative phosphorylation stability and lower reactive species outputs with hypoxic exposure, and this may protect cardiac bioenergetic function in hypoxic tropical waters.

AB Warming temperatures and diminishing dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations are among the most pervasive drivers of global coastal change. While regions of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean are experiencing greater than average warming, the combined effects of thermal and hypoxic stress on marine life in this region are poorly understood. Populations of the northern bay scallop, Argopecten irradians irradians across the northeast United States have experienced severe declines in recent decades. This study used a combination of high-resolution (similar to 1 km) satellite-based temperature records, long-term temperature and DO records, field and laboratory experiments, and high-frequency measures of scallop cardiac activity in an ecosystem setting to quantify decadal summer warming and assess the vulnerability of northern bay scallops to thermal and hypoxic stress across their geographic distribution. From 2003 to 2020, significant summer warming (up to similar to 0.2 degrees C year(-1)) occurred across most of the bay scallop range. At a New York field site in 2020, all individuals perished during an 8-day estuarine heatwave that coincided with severe diel-cycling hypoxia. Yet at a Massachusetts site with comparable DO levels but lower daily mean temperatures, mortality was not observed. A 96-h laboratory experiment recreating observed daily temperatures of 25 or 29 degrees C, and normoxia or hypoxia (22.2% air saturation), revealed a 120-fold increased likelihood of mortality in the 29 degrees C-hypoxic treatment compared with control conditions, with scallop clearance rates also reduced by 97%. Cardiac activity measurements during a field deployment indicated that low DO and elevated daily temperatures modulate oxygen consumption rates and likely impact aerobic scope. Collectively, these findings suggest that concomitant thermal and hypoxic stress can have detrimental effects on scallop physiology and survival and potentially disrupt entire fisheries. Recovery of hypoxic systems may benefit vulnerable fisheries under continued warming.

AB Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common chronic liver disease worldwide and comprises varied grades of intrahepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis; the most severe cases result in cirrhosis and liver failure. There is extensive clinical and experimental evidence indicating that chronic intermittent hypoxia, featuring a respiratory disorder of growing prevalence worldwide termed obstructive sleep apnea, could contribute to the progression of NAFLD from simple steatosis, also termed non-alcoholic fatty liver or hepatosteatosis, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; however, the molecular mechanisms by which hypoxia might contribute to hepatosteatosis setup and progression still remain to be fully elucidated. In this review, we have prepared an overview about the link between hypoxia and lipid accumulation within the liver, focusing on the impact of hypoxia on the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatosteatosis onset.

AB Much hypoxia research has been carried out at high altitude in a hypobaric hypoxia (HH) environment. Many research teams seek to replicate high-altitude conditions at lower altitudes in either hypobaric hypoxic conditions or normobaric hypoxic (NH) laboratories. Implicit in this approach is the assumption that the only relevant condition that differs between these settings is the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), which is commonly presumed to be the principal physiological stimulus to adaptation at high altitude. This systematic review is the first to present an overview of the current available literature regarding crossover studies relating to the different effects of HH and NH on human physiology. After applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13 studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. Several studies reported a number of variables (e.g. minute ventilation and NO levels) that were different between the two conditions, lending support to the notion that true physiological difference is indeed present. However, the presence of confounding factors such as time spent in hypoxia, temperature, and humidity, and the limited statistical power due to small sample sizes, limit the conclusions that can be drawn from these findings. Standardisation of the study methods and reporting may aid interpretation of future studies and thereby improve the quality of data in this area. This is important to improve the quality of data that is used for improving the understanding of hypoxia tolerance, both at altitude and in the clinical setting.

AB To determine the effects of prolonged hypoxia and hypoxia reoxygenation in senescent blood vessels, isolated aortic rings from 4- and 24-month-old (mo) Wistar rats were submitted to prolonged hypoxia (50 min) or hypoxia reoxygenation (20 min 30 min) and contractile function recorded. Phenylephrine-induced contraction and sodium nitroprusside and acetylcholine-induced relaxations were measured after hypoxia or after hypoxia, reoxygenation. In 24 mo group, prolonged hypoxia increased ( + 83%. P < 0.01) and prolonged initial hypoxic contraction, while hypoxic relaxation and delayed contraction were unchanged. Relaxation to acetylcholine was more reduced than in 4 mo group while contraction to phenylephrine and relaxation to sodium nitroprusside were similarly impaired, During reoxygenation, contraction as of same amplitude at both ages and the relaxation to acetylcholine was impaired but to a similiar extent in both groups. In conclusion, hypoxic stress induces a greater endothelium-injury in senescent aorta, and increased transient hypoxic contraction, without aggravation of late hypoxic contraction. Agings not exacerbate the impairment of aortic vasoreactivity after hypoxia-reoxygenation. especially endothelium-dependent relaxation, in sharp contrast to prolonged hypoxia, These age-related changes in vascular sensitivity to oxygen deprivation are different from those observed in coronary arteries, indicating that vasoreactivity during such Pathological stress strongly depends on the type of vessel. especially during aging.

AB Carotid body type-I cells respond to acute hypoxia with membrane depolarization and calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release. The inhibition of a TASK-like background potassium channels plays a key role in initiating this response. Chronic hypoxia enhances the carotid body chemosensory responses evoked by acute hypoxia, however the accurate mechanism by which chronic hypoxia increases carotid body reactivity is not clear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of chronic hypoxia upon TASK-like currents in isolated type-I cells. Carotid bodies were excised from anaesthetized newborn Sprague-Dawley rats and dissociated by collagenase-trypsin digestion. Isolated cells were maintained under 5% CO2 in normoxic (21% O-2) or hypoxic (1-2% O-2) environment for 24 and 48 hours. Channel activity (NPo) was recorded using the cell-attached configuration of the patch-clamp technique. In normoxic and 24 hours hypoxic cultured cells, acute hypoxic stimuli decreases NPo approximately 70% with no effects on current amplitude. On the other hand, in cultured cells subjected to 48 hours of hypoxia, NPo decreases near to 90% in response to acute hypoxia. We concluded that continuous hypoxic exposure enhances the TASK-like channel activity inhibition in response to acute hypoxia. Our results provide a potential mechanism by which chronic hypoxia increases carotid body reactivity.

AB Hypoxia is a common physiological feature of tumours. It activates a signalling cascade that culminates in the stabilization of the HIF-1 transcription factor and activation of genes that possess a hypoxia response element (HRE). We have used an optimized hypoxia responsive promoter (OBHRE) to investigate hypoxia-targeted gene expression in vivo in the context of an adenovirus vector. The OBHRE promoter showed limited activity in the liver or spleen such that expression was 1000-fold lower than that driven by the strong CMV/IE promoter. However, in the context of the tumour microenvironment, the OBHRE promoter achieved expression levels comparable to that of the CMV/IE promoter. Next, we showed that an adenovirus expressing the human cytochrome P450 (CYP2B6) regulated by the OBHRE promoter delays tumour growth in response to the prodrug cyclophosphamide (CPA). Finally, we exploited the hepatotropism of adenovirus to investigate whether the OBHRE promoter could mitigate the hepatotoxicity of a recombinant adenovirus expressing thymidine kinase (TK) in the context of the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV). High-dose Ad. CMVTK/GCV treatment caused significant liver necrosis whereas the same dose of Ad.HRETK was well tolerated. These in vivo data demonstrate that hypoxia-targeted gene expression via the OBHRE promoter can be used to increase the therapeutic window of cytotoxic cancer gene therapy.

AB Postoperative hypoxia is a challenge for surgeons. With the advent of better anesthesia and minimal access surgical techniques, the incidence of postoperative hypoxia in elective cases has decreased. However, the incidence in life-saving emergency procedures still poses a possible threat, and cases seem under-reported. We report a series of five cases of postoperative hypoxia after laparotomy. These cases comprise mesenteric laceration, proximal jejunal perforation, perforated duodenal ulcer, abdominal tuberculosis, and fall from height. Despite different etiologies, they landed up with the complication of postoperative hypoxia, which was attributable to the type of procedure they underwent and not the indication of the procedure itself. Thus, they form an interesting collection of post-laparotomy hypoxia cases. We present them with a compilation of probable causes of postoperative hypoxia in such cases.Postoperative hypoxia presents a diagnostic challenge and requires timely suspicion, prompt intervention to eliminate the cause, and good postoperative care. The major causes include incomplete lung re-expansion, pain-induced restriction in chest-wall/diaphragm mobility, prolonged surgery, a complication of pre-existing lung disease, residual effects of some drugs, and iatrogenic causes. We, therefore, recommend the use of postoperative oxygen support and diligent monitoring of vitals in all cases of laparotomy, allowing prompt and timely patient management. Future studies are warranted to explore the prevalence and possible causes of post-laparotomy hypoxia.

AB Hypoxia is one of the prominent features of solid tumors. Hypoxia activated prodrugs (HAPs), selectively killing hypoxic cells, possess the potential to transform hypoxia from a nuisance to an advantage in precision therapy. Exhibiting a more significant hypoxic microenvironment, gliomas, as the most frequent and incurable neurological tumors, provide HAPs a more attractive therapeutic prospect. However, the insufficient hypoxia and the obstruction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) severely limit the activation and bio-availability of HAPs. Herein, a novel nanoparticle iRGD@ZnPc + TPZ was designed and synthesized to achieve gliomas inhibition by encapsulating tirapazamine (TPZ) as a HAP and zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) as a photosensitizer to enhance hypoxia. iRGD@ZnPc + TPZ can realize breakthrough BBB, deep penetration, and significant retention in gliomas, which is attributed to the iRGD-mediated receptor targeting and active transport. After being internalized by tumor cells and radiated, ZnPc efficiently consumes intratumoral O2 to produce reactive oxygen species, which not only implements tumor suppression, but also intensify hypoxia to activate TPZ for amplifying chemotherapy. The photosensitizer-enhanced activation of HAPs inhibits gliomas growth. This study provides a new strategy with sensitizing and activating HAPs for gliomas treatment in clinical.

AB Sarcopenia is the physiological age-related reduction of muscle mass and strength. Considering that life span is correlated with metabolic rate and mitochondria are the site of oxygen consumption, muscle mitochondria volume densities were determined by morphometric analysis. We found a tight correlation between aging and hypoxia with decrease in muscle total mitochondria volume. Therefore, hypoxia and aging seem to share some common pathways, allowing hypoxic models to be used for the study of the aging processes. Additional research will be required to fully elucidate the correlations among aging, sarcopenia and hypoxia, but these findings provide a starting point for such investigations.

AB Oxygen is a molecule that is central to cellular respiration and viability, yet there are multiple physiologic and pathological contexts in which cells experience conditions of insufficient oxygen availability, a state known as hypoxia. Given the metabolic challenges of a low oxygen environment, hypoxia elicits a range of adaptive responses at the cellular, tissue, and systemic level to promote continued survival and function. Within this context, T lymphocytes are a highly migratory cell type of the adaptive immune system that frequently encounters a wide range of oxygen tensions in both health and disease. It is now clear that oxygen availability regulates T cell differentiation and function, a response orchestrated in large part by the hypoxia-inducible factor transcription factors. Here, we discuss the physiologic scope of hypoxia and hypoxic signaling, the contribution of these pathways in regulating T cell biology, and current gaps in our understanding. Finally, we discuss how emerging therapies that modulate the hypoxic response may offer new modalities to alter T cell function and the outcome of acute and chronic pathologies.

AB Astrocytes provide the structural and functional interface between the cerebral circulation and neuronal networks. They enwrap all intracerebral arterioles and capillaries, control the flux of nutrients as well as the ionic and metabolic environment of the neuropil. Astrocytes have the ability to adjust cerebral blood flow to maintain constant PO2 and PCO2 of the brain parenchyma. Release of ATP in the brainstem, presumably by local astrocytes, helps to maintain breathing and counteract hypoxia-induced depression of the respiratory network. Astrocytes also appear to be involved in mediating hypoxia-evoked changes in blood-brain barrier permeability, brain inflammation, and neuroprotection against ischaemic injury. Thus, astrocytes appear to play a fundamental role in supporting neuronal function not only in normal conditions but also in pathophysiological states when supply of oxygen to the brain is compromised.

AB Since the first identification of hypoxic cells in sections of carcinomas in the 1950s, hypoxia has been known as a central hallmark of cancer cells and their microenvironment. Indeed, hypoxia benefits cancer cells in their growth, survival, and metastasis. The historical discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1A) in the early 1990s had a great influence on the field as many phenomena in hypoxia could be explained by HIF1A. However, not all regions or types of tumors are necessarily hypoxic. Thus, it is difficult to explain whole cancer pathobiology by hypoxia, especially in the early stage of cancer. Upregulation of glucose metabolism in cancer cells has been well known. Oxygen-independent glycolysis is activated in cancer cells even in the normoxia condition, which is known as the Warburg effect. Accumulating evidence and recent advances in cancer metabolism research suggest that hypoxia-independent mechanisms for HIF signaling activation is a hallmark for cancer. There are various mechanisms that generate pseudohypoxic conditions, even in normoxia. Given the importance of HIF1A for cancer pathobiology, the pseudohypoxia concept could shed light on the longstanding mystery of the Warburg effect and accelerate better understanding of the diverse phenomena seen in a variety of cancers.

AB Altered vasculature and the resultant chaotic tumor blood flow lead to the appearance in fast-growing tumors of regions with gradients of oxygen tension and acute hypoxia (less than 1.4% oxygen).1 Due to its roles in tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy, hypoxia represents a problem in cancer therapy.1,2 Insufficient delivery of therapeutic agents to the hypoxic regions in solid tumors is recognized as one of the causes of resistance to therapy.1,3 This led to the development of hypoxia imaging agents,4 and the use of hypoxia-activated anticancer prodrugs.2a Here we show the first example of the hypoxia-induced siRNA uptake and silencing using a nanocarrier consisting of polyethyleneglycol2000, azobenzene, polyethyleneimine(PEI)(1.8kDa), and 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) units (the nanocarrier is referred to as PAPD), where azobenzene imparts hypoxia sensitivity and specificity.4a We report hypoxia-activated green fluorescent protein (GFP) silencing in vitro and its downregulation in GFP-expressing tumors after intravenous administration. The proposed nanoformulation represents a novel tumor-environment-responsive modality for cancer targeting and siRNA delivery.

AB Dark caves lacking primary productivity can expose subterranean animals to hypoxia. We used the surface-dwelling (surface fish) and cave-dwelling (cavefish) morphs of Astyanax mexicanus as a model for understanding the mechanisms of hypoxia tolerance in the cave environment. Primitive hematopoiesis, which is restricted to the posterior lateral mesoderm in other teleosts, also occurs in the anterior lateral mesoderm in Astyanax, potentially pre-adapting surface fish for hypoxic cave colonization. Cavefish have enlarged both hematopoietic domains and develop more erythrocytes than surface fish, which are required for normal development in both morphs. Laboratory-induced hypoxia suppresses growth in surface fish but not in cavefish. Both morphs respond to hypoxia by overexpressing hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (hif1) pathway genes, and some hif1 genes are constitutively upregulated in normoxic cavefish to similar levels as in hypoxic surface fish. We conclude that cavefish cope with hypoxia by increasing erythrocyte development and constitutive hif1 gene overexpression.

AB Exposure to developmental hypoxia can have long-term impacts on the physiological performance of fish because of irreversible plasticity. Wild and captive-reared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) can be exposed to hypoxic conditions during development and continue to experience fluctuating oxygen levels as juveniles and adults. Here, we examine whether developmental hypoxia impacts subsequent hypoxia tolerance and aerobic performance of Atlantic salmon. Individuals at 8 degrees C were exposed to 50% (hypoxia) or 100%(normoxia) dissolved oxygen(DO) saturation(as percent of air saturation) from fertilization for similar to 100 d (800 degree days) andthenraisedinnormoxic conditions for a further 15 mo. At 18 mo after fertilization, aerobic scope was calculated in normoxia (100% DO) and acute (18 h) hypoxia (50% DO) from the difference between the minimum and maximum oxygen consumption rates ((M) over dotO(2min) and (M) over dotO(2max), respectively) at 10 degrees C. Hypoxia tolerance was determined as the DO at which loss of equilibrium (LOE) occurred in a constantly decreasing DO environment. There was no difference in (M) over dotO(2min), (M) over dotO(2max), or aerobic scope between fish raised in hypoxia or normoxia. There was some evidence that hypoxia tolerance was lower (higher DO at LOE) in hypoxiaraised fish compared with those raised in normoxia, but the magnitude of the effect was small (12.52% DO vs. 11.73% DO at LOE). Acute hypoxia significantly reduced aerobic scope by reducing (M) over dotO(2max), while (M) over dotO(2min) remained unchanged. Interestingly, acute hypoxia uncovered individual-level relationships between DO at LOE and (M) over dotO(2min), (M) over dotO(2max), and aerobic scope. We discuss our findings in the context of developmental trajectories and the role of aerobic performance in hypoxia tolerance.

AB Hypoxia [dissolved oxygen (DO) < 2 mg L-1] is a major environmental perturbation for many aquatic ecosystems, particularly highly productive estuaries. Most research attention and understanding about the impacts of hypoxia on estuarine species has focused on the benthos, where hypoxia is most common. Although the pelagic zone is also susceptible to the effects of hypoxia, the biological interactions and consequences are not as well understood in marine environments because documenting exposure or avoidance of hypoxia is often difficult. Physiological biomarkers may provide a way to gain more detailed spatiotemporal information regarding species' exposure to hypoxia. Here, we identified and tested a hypoxia-specific responsive gene, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (hif-1 alpha), to evaluate its potential as a biomarker for hypoxia exposure in Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii). We conducted controlled laboratory experiments to establish the level of hepatic hif-1 alpha elevated gene expression (>1 sd normoxic mean), exposure amplification (>= 2 hours), reduction rate (ca. 24 hours), and some evidence of a lethal hypoxic limit (ca. 2 mg L-1, >= hours). We then used these findings to evaluate the spatiotemporal patterns of hif-1 alpha for Pacific herring in a seasonally hypoxia estuary, Hood Canal, Washington, USA Although expression did not parallel the local hypoxic conditions in the estuary, herring from the more severe hypoxic year (2013) had a higher probability of having elevated mRNA levels. These patterns indicate that hepatic hif-1 alpha levels may not be directly indicative of local DO levels for pelagic marine fish, but rather provide insight into hypoxia exposure over broader scales.

AB Hypoxia is an inherent pathophysiological characteristic of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is closely associated with the development of renal inflammation and fibrosis, as well as CKD-related complications such as anaemia, cardiovascular events, and sarcopenia. This review outlined the characteristics of oxygen supply in the kidney, changes in oxygen metabolism and factors leading to hypoxia in CKD. Mechanistically, we discussed how hypoxia contributes to renal injury as well as complications associated with CKD. Furthermore, we also discussed the potential therapeutic approaches that target chronic hypoxia, as well as the challenges in the study of oxygen homeostasis imbalance in CKD.

AB The ability of cells to sense and adapt to changes in oxygen is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIP). Immune cells function in physiologically complex and varying environments whereby oxygen, pH, nutrients, metabolites and cytokines are continuously fluctuating. HIF is well known to play an important role in coordinating the adaptation and function of both innate immune cells and T cells in these complex environments. This review summarises recent discoveries concerning how hypoxia and HIF control B cell behaviour, and regulate antibody quality and decisions concerning tolerance. Hypoxia and HIF activation may provide an important context; coordinating metabolism with variable demands for quiescence, rapid proliferation, and differentiation. Understanding when and how HIP is activated during B cell development and response is important as drugs targeting HIF could influence antibody responses, providing novel therapeutic opportunities for vaccine adjuvants and in treating autoimmunity.

AB The liver is a central organ that metabolizes excessive nutrients for storage in the form of glycogen and lipids and supplies energy-producing substrates to the peripheral tissues to maintain their function, even under starved conditions. These processes require a considerable amount of oxygen, which causes a steep oxygen gradient throughout the hepatic lobules. Alcohol consumption and/or excessive food intake can alter the hepatic metabolic balance drastically, which can precipitate fatty liver disease, a major cause of chronic liver diseases worldwide, ranging from simple steatosis, through steatohepatitis and hepatic fibrosis, to liver cirrhosis. Altered hepatic metabolism and tissue remodeling in fatty liver disease further disrupt hepatic oxygen homeostasis, resulting in severe liver hypoxia. As master regulators of adaptive responses to hypoxic stress, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) modulate various cellular and organ functions, including erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, metabolic demand, and cell survival, by activating their target genes during fetal development and also in many disease conditions such as cancer, heart failure, and diabetes. In the past decade, it has become clear that HIFs serve as key factors in the regulation of lipid metabolism and fatty liver formation. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms by which hypoxia and HIFs regulate lipid metabolism in the development and progression of fatty liver disease. (C) 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

AB The majority of vertebrates are not tolerant to hypoxia but epaulette sharks (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) living on shallow reef platforms appear to tolerate hypoxic periods during tidal fluctuations. The effects of progressive hypoxia on the metabolic and ventilatory responses of these elasmobranchs were examined in a closed respirometer. In order to determine whether repeated exposure to hypoxia primes these sharks to alter their metabolism, one group of sharks was exposed to repeated sub-lethal hypoxia, at 5% of air saturation, prior to respirometry: In response to falling oxygen concentration [O-2], the epaulette shark increased its ventilator), rate and maintained its O-2 consumption rate (V-O2) down to 2.2 mg O-2 l(-1) at 25degreesC. This is the lowest critical [O-2] ([O-2](crit) ever measured for any elasmobranch. After reaching the [O-2](crit), the shark remained in the respirometer for a further 4-5 h of progressive hypoxia. Only after the [O-2] fell to 1.0 mg l(-1) was there a decrease in the ventilatory rate followed by a rise in blood lactate levels, indicating that the epaulette shark responds to severe hypoxia by entering a phase of metabolic and ventilatory depression. Interestingly, hypoxia tolerance was dynamic because hypoxic pre-conditioning lowered the V-O2 of the epaulette shark by 29%, which resulted in a significantly reduced [O-2](crit) (1.7 mg O-2 l(-1)), revealing that hypoxic pre-conditioning elicits an enhanced physiological response to hypoxia.

AB In some organisms and cells, oxygen availability influences oxygen consumption. In this review, we examine this phenomenon of hypoxic hypometabolism (HH), discussing its features, mechanisms, and implications. Small mammals and other vertebrate species exhibit "oxyconformism," a downregulation of metabolic rate and body temperature during hypoxia which is sensed by the central nervous system. Smaller body mass and cooler ambient temperature contribute to a high metabolic rate in mammals. It is this hypermetabolic state that is suppressed by hypoxia leading to HH. Larger mammals including humans do not exhibit HH. Tissues and cells also exhibit reductions in respiration during hypoxia in vitro, even at oxygen levels ample for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The mechanisms of cellular HH involve intracellular oxygen sensors including hypoxia-inducible factors, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) which downregulate mitochondrial activity and ATP utilization. HH has a profound impact on cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic physiology in rodents. Therefore, caution should be exercised when extrapolating the results of rodent hypoxia studies to human physiology.

AB Hypoxia is an often seen problem resulting from conditions such as ischemia, hemorrhage, stroke, premature birth, and other cardiovascular difficulties. To find useful remedies that are capable of ameliorating its casualty is an essential effort. Although the underlying mechanisms of the hypoxia-induce injury and cell death are still not fully understood, it has been shown that hypoxia induces nitric oxide (NO) overproduction and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) overexpression that play important roles in producing injury including increases in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) infiltration to injured tissues and leukotriene B-4 (LTB4) generation. Moreover, it has been evident that transcription factors responsible for iNOS expression are also altered by hypoxia. Hypoxia also increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration, tumor necrosis factor-a, lipid peroxidation, prostaglandin E, production, activity of caspase-3 and -9, and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, apoptosis inducible factor, and endonuclease G. However, it has been shown that downregulation of iNOS can limit cell injury caused by hypoxia. In our laboratory, we have found that treatment with either iNOS inhibitors or iNOS siRNA inhibits iNOS expression, reduces lipid peroxidation, apoptosome formation, and cellular caspase-3 activity, preserves cellular ATP levels, and increases cell survival. Therefore, iNOS inhibition may be a novel mechanism for protection from hypoxia-induced injury and cell death.

AB Hypoxia, due to impaired cerebral blood flow, has hazardous effects on brain structure and function. Therefore, mechanisms should exist to meet the needs for hypoxic adaptation via regulation of gene expression. Signaling between the O-2 sensor and the regulator(s) of transcription is only partially characterized and requires regulatory transcription factors. Among these regulatory proteins, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) appears to have a key role. HIF-1 modulates gene activity in response to low O-2 tensions in the developing and in the adult brain. Moderate hypoxia may elicit autoprotective mechanisms or hypoxia-induced regulators can contribute to mechanisms leading to cell death. Moreover, reactivation of embryonic gene expression may occur after injury-induced hypoxia. Thus, analyses of embryonic and pathogenic models should help to understand how hypoxia-mediated proliferative/cell death processes are involved in brain development and in the pathogenesis of acute or chronic neurodegenerative brain diseases.

AB Hypoxia inducible transcription factor (HIF)-1 alpha plays an important role in the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, but little is known about HIF-2 alpha and HIF-3 alpha with respect to transcriptional regulation by hypoxia. To examine the expression patterns of all HIF-alpha subunits (HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha and HIF-3 alpha) in pulmonary arteries of rats undergoing systemic hypoxia, five groups of healthy male Wistar rats were exposed to normoxia (N) and hypoxia for 3 (H-3), 7 (H-7), 14 (H-14) and 21 (H-21) d respectively. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), vessel morphometry and right ventricular hypertrophy index were measured. Lungs were inflation fixed for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, and homogenized for Western blot. mPAP increased significantly after 7 d of hypoxia [(18.4 +/- 0.4) vs. (14.4 +/- 0.4) mmHg, H-7 vs N], reached its peak after 14 d of hypoxia, then remained stable. Pulmonary artery remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy developed significantly after 14 d of hypoxia. During normoxia, HIF-1 alpha and HIF-3 alpha staining were slightly positive regarding mRNA levels. A substantial alteration of HIF-1 alpha and HIF-3 alpha staining occurred in pulmonary arteries after 14 d and 7 d of hypoxia, respectively, but HIF-2 alpha staining showed an inversed trend after 14 d of hypoxia. Protein levels of all HIF-alpha subunits except HIF-3 alpha showed a marked increase corresponding to the duration of hypoxia, which was obtained by Western blot. Our study found that HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha and HIF-3 alpha may not only confer different target genes, but also play key pathogenetic roles in hypoxic-induced pulmonary hypertension.

AB Hypoxia elicits complex cell signaling mechanisms in the respiratory control system that can produce long-lasting changes in respiratory motor output. In this article, we review experimental approaches used to elucidate signaling pathways associated with hypoxia, and summarize current hypotheses regarding the intracellular signaling pathways evoked by intermittent exposure to hypoxia. We review data showing that pharmacological treatments can enhance neuroplastic responses to hypoxia. Original data are included to show that pharmacological modulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) function can reveal a respiratory neuroplastic response to a single, brief hypoxic exposure in anesthetized mice. Coupling pharmacologic treatments with therapeutic hypoxia paradigms may have rehabilitative value following neurologic injury or during neuromuscular disease. Depending on prevailing conditions, pharmacologic treatments can enable hypoxia-induced expression of neuroplasticity and increased respiratory motor output, or potentially could synergistically interact with hypoxia to more robustly increase motor output.

AB Hypoxic environments occur normally at high altitude, or in underground burrows and in deep sea habitats. They also occur pathologically in human ischemia and in hypoxic solid tumors. Hypoxia in various cancer types and its related molecular mechanisms are associated with a poor clinical outcome. This review will discuss how hypoxia can influence two aspects of tumorigenesis, namely the direct, cell-intrinsic oncogenic effects, as well as the indirect effects on tumor progression mediated by an altered tumor microenvironment. We will also discuss recent progress in identifying the functional roles of hypoxia-related factors (HIFs), along with their regulators and downstream target genes, in cancer stem cells and therapy. Importantly, we propose, using convergent evolution schemes to identify novel biomarkers for both hypoxia adaptation and hypoxic solid tumors as an important strategy in the future.

AB Many tumors contain hypoxic regions. Hypoxia, in turn, is known to increase aggressiveness and to be associated with treatment resistance. The two most frequently described and investigated subtypes of tumor hypoxia are acute and chronic. These two subtypes can lead to completely different hypoxia-related responses within the tumor, which could have a direct effect on tumor development and response to treatment. In order to accurately assess the specific biological consequences, it is important to understand which time frames best define acute and chronic hypoxia.
   This article provides an overview of the kinetics of in vitro and in vivo acute and chronic tumor hypoxia. Special attention was paid to differentiate between methods to detect spontaneous in vivo hypoxia and to describe the biological effects of experimental in vitro and in vivo acute and chronic tumor hypoxia.
   There are large variations in reported spontaneous fluctuations in acute hypoxia that are dependent on the cell lines investigated and the detection method used. In addition to differing hypoxia levels, exposure times used to induce in vitro and in vivo experimental acute and chronic hypoxia range from 30 min to several weeks with no clear boundaries separating the two. Evaluation of the biological consequences of each hypoxia subtype revealed a general trend that acute hypoxia leads to a more aggressive phenotype. Importantly, more information on the occurrence of acute and chronic hypoxia in human tumors is needed to help our understanding of the clinical consequences.

AB During wakefulness, cerebral blood flow (CBF) is closely coupled to regional cerebral metabolism; however CBF is also strongly modulated by breathing, increasing in response to both hypercapnia and hypoxia. During stage III/IV non-rapid eye (NREM) sleep, cerebral metabolism and CBF decrease whilst the partial pressure of arterial Cot increases due to a reduction in alveolar ventilation. The reduction in CBF during NREM sleep therefore occurs despite a relative state of hypercapnia. We have used transcranial Doppler ultrasound to determine middle cerebral artery velocity, as an index of CBF, and have determined that NREM sleep is associated with a reduction in the cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia. This reduction in reactivity would, at least in part, allow the observed reductions in CBF id this state. Similarly, we have observed that the CBF response to hypoxia is absent during stage III/IV NREM sleep. Nocturnal hypoxia and hypercapnia are major pathogenic factor associated with cardio-respiratory diseases. These marked changes in cerebrovascular control that occur during sleep suggest that the cerebral circulation may be particularly vulnerable to cardio-respiratory insults during this period.

AB The influence of native mountain, artificial acute and interrupted prolonged barochamber hypoxia on the tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) level in blood and tissues was studied in Wistar rats. All types of hypoxia induced an elevation of blood t-PA activity due to a stimulatory effect on the lung vascular endothelium. In contrast to acute barochamber hypoxia a middle-term adaptation to the hypoxic circumstances caused a stable enhancement of blood t-PA activity. The acute barochamber hypoxia by an unknown pathway stimulated only the release of t-PA, but the long-lasting hypoxia caused both the secretion and synthesis of t-PA de novo.

AB Tissue hypoxia is a common pathophysiological process. Since 1990s, numerous studies have focused on investigating cellular adaptation to experimental hypoxia. A modular incubator chamber made of solid materials has frequently been used in the experiments that require hypoxic conditions. Here, we introduce a novel and inflatable chamber for hypoxia experiments. In experiments detecting hypoxia-induced accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1-regulated genes, the new chamber yielded reproducible and comparable results as the modular incubator chamber did. The new chamber did not create inner chamber pressure during its use. Other properties of the new chamber were low-cost, easy to use, and leakage-free. Moreover, the size of the new chamber was adjustable, and the smaller one could be placed onto an inverted microscope for real-time studies. The successful examples of real-time studies included the real-time recording of GFP-HIF-1 alpha fusion nuclear translocation and endothelial cell tubular formation.

AB Prolonged periods of extreme warm and cold seawater temperature anomalies, known as marine heatwaves (MHWs) and marine cold spells (MCSs), respectively, can have significant impacts on coastal marine ecosystems. Prior research has examined the co-occurrence of multiple extremes [low dissolved oxygen (DO) and/or low pH] during MHWs, with the impact of these compound events potentially exceeding that of a single stressor due to synergistic effects. However, we are not aware of any studies that have examined compound extreme events during MCSs, despite the ecosystem implications. Along Eastern Boundary Current Upwelling Systems (EBUS), strong-wind driven upwelling has led to reduced warming trends and persistence of MCSs, as well as an increased seasonal risk for coastal hypoxia via the cross-shelf advection of cold, low DO subthermocline waters. In this short communication, we investigated for the first time compound MCS-hypoxic events at a nearshore site in central California using several decades of nearshore water temperature data, short-term nearshore DO data, and several decades of DO data from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations program. From 1988 to 2020, we identified 55 MCS events, with 50 events (-90.9%) initiated during anomalously strong upwelling. Using long-term temperature -DO relationships, we identified 20 of the 55 MCS events (-34.6%) as potential compound MCS-hypoxic events, with an average duration of 11.7 days. These compound events occurred almost exclusively during the major upwelling season (March to June) when there is a high propensity for the advection of cold, low DO subthermocline waters from the adjacent shelf into the nearshore. This work provides the first known investigation into the co-occurrence of MCS and hypoxic events in a nearshore upwelling system and provides a baseline for assessing future changes to these compound events in a changing climate, with important implications for ecosystem health in EBUS globally.

AB Feeding and systemic hypoxia are major stresses inducing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). This study aims to investigate the role of systemic hypoxia in NEC and its effect before and after feeding.
   Neonatal mice were studied in three groups. Control (N = 9): breast feeding; NEC A (N = 8), gavage feeding + lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + preprandial hypoxia; and NEC B (N = 9), feeding + LPS + postprandial hypoxia. Pimonidazole, a hypoxia marker, was injected intraperitoneally before ileum was harvested for histology and quantitative RT-PCR studies. Statistical analysis was done using the ANOVA and Chi-square test.
   NEC incidence was 62.5% in NEC A and 88.9% in NEC B. The mortality in NEC B (55.6%) but not A (25%) is significantly higher than control (0%, p < 0.05). Pimonidazole staining elevated in both NEC A and B with higher pimonidazole grade in NEC B (p < 0.01). Both NEC groups had increased the expression of hypoxia-related genes: HIF-1 alpha, GLUT-1, and PHD-3 with GLUT-1 expressed more in NEC B compared with NEC A (p < 0.01). The inflammation marker, IL6, was similarly raised in both NEC A and B.
   Feeding and postprandial hypoxia synergistically induce intestinal hypoxia in NEC. As feeding increases intestinal oxygen demand, maintaining a balance between intestinal oxygen supply and demand is important to prevent NEC.

AB Rapidly growing tumors invariably contain hypoxic regions. Adaptive response to hypoxia through angiogenesis, enhanced glucose metabolism and diminished but optimized mitochondrial respiration confers survival and growth advantage to hypoxic tumor cells. In this review, the roles of hypoxia, the hypoxia inducible factors, oncogenes and tumor suppressors in metabolic adaptation of tumors are discussed. These new insights into hypoxic metabolic alterations in tumors will hopefully lead us to target tumor bioenergetics for the treatment of cancers.

AB Hypoxia is an important feature of the tumor microenvironment, and is closely associated with cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metabolism and the tumor immune response. All these factors can further promote tumor progression, increase tumor aggressiveness, enhance tumor metastatic potential and lead to poor prognosis. In this review, these effects of hypoxia on tumor biology will be discussed, along with their significance for tumor detection and treatment.

AB The role of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) subunits 1alpha and 1beta in cellular response to hypoxia is well established, whereas little is known about HIF-2alpha and HIF-3alpha with respect to organ distribution and transcriptional regulation by hypoxia. We investigated mRNA levels of all HIF subunits and of their target genes erythropoietin (EPO) and glucose-transporter 1 (GLUT1) in rats undergoing systemic hypoxia for 30 or 120 min by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. In normoxia, persistently high mRNA levels of all HIF subunits were detected in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and lung; the heart contained the lowest amounts. Hypoxia did not affect mRNA levels of HIF-1alpha, -1beta, and -2alpha. HIF-3alpha mRNA levels increased in all organs examined after 2 h of hypoxia. A significant rise of EPO and GLUT1 mRNA levels occurred in cortex, heart, liver, and kidney after 2 h of hypoxia, indicating activation of the HIF system. Protein levels of all HIF subunits, determined in brain and lung by immunoblotting, showed a marked increase corresponding to the duration of hypoxia. Our results suggest that induction at the transcriptional level is a unique feature of HIF-3alpha, which therefore may represent a rapidly reacting component of the HIF system in protection against hypoxic damage.

   Aim: Exposure to hypoxia is known to increase oxidative stress and to impair antioxidant defenses in humans. The aim of the study was to measure oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity in healthy humans after being acutely exposed to both intermittent hypoxia-normoxia (IHN) and intermittent hypoxia-hyperoxia (IHH).
   Methods: Twenty-one healthy, young male participants were exposed to both IHN and IHH (fraction of inspired oxygen [FIO2] 0.11 for up to 7 minutes followed by 3-5 minutes of exposure to normoxia (room air) or hyperoxia, FIO2 0.3-0.35) in a crossover design study. In each participant, oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity were measured before and after each exposure in both experimental conditions.
   Results: After IHN, compared with baseline, neither oxidative stress (289.1 +/- 63.2 vs. 262.2 +/- 85.2 UCarr) nor antioxidant capacity (2376.1 +/- 452.9 vs. 2525.0 +/- 400.7 UCor) was significantly different. After IHH, neither oxidative stress (285.1 +/- 94.2 vs. 277.5 +/- 86.7 UCarr) nor antioxidant capacity (2653.6 +/- 492.7 vs. 2568.4 +/- 427.4 UCor) was significantly different compared with baseline. When the two studied exposure modalities were compared, there was no significant difference between groups with respect to both oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity.
   Conclusions: These data suggest that exposing healthy individuals to short-term IHN and IHH does not increase oxidative stress and it does not impair antioxidant defenses.

AB The regulatory peptide apelin is the endogenous ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor APJ. Apelin and APJ exist in a variety of tissues, with special status in the heart, lung and tumors. Consequently, the apelin/APJ system exerts a broad range of activities that affect multiple organ systems. Accumulating evidence indicates that the expressions of apelin and APJ are significantly augmented by hypoxia through the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-l alpha.) signaling pathway. Increased apelin promotes cellular proliferation, migration and survival, therefore regulating angiogenesis. In addition, the pre-administration of exogenous apelin is involved in the occurrence and development of hypoxia-induced pathological diseases. The purpose of this article is to review the properties of the apelin/APJ system, which is affected by hypoxic conditions, and the regulation of apelin/APJ signaling in hypoxia-associated disorders. Thus, the apelin/APJ system may be a potential therapeutic target in hypoxia-related diseases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We tested the hypothesis that the post-hypoxia frequency decline of phrenic nerve activity following brief, isocapnic hypoxic episodes in rats is diminished by prior hypoxic episodes and alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor antagonism. Anesthetized (urethane), artificially ventilated (F(IO2) = 0.50) and vagotomized rats were presented with two or three, 5 min episodes of isocapnic hypoxia (F(IO2) =o.11) separated by 30 min of control, hyperoxic conditions. Phrenic nerve discharge, end-tidal CO, and arterial blood gases were measured before during and after hypoxia. The average maximum frequency decline, measured 5 min after the first hypoxic episode, was 26 +/- 7 bursts/min below pre-hypoxic baseline values (a 70 +/- 16% decrease). By 30 min post-hypoxia, frequency had returned to baseline. Two groups of rats were then administered either: (1) saline (sham) or (2) the alpha(2)-receptor antagonist, RX821002 HCl (2-[2-(2-Methoxy-1,4-benzodioxanyl)l imidazoline hydrochloride; 0.25 mg/kg, i.v.). Isocapnic hypoxia was repeated 10 min later. In sham rats, the post-hypoxia frequency decline (PHFD) was significantly attenuated relative to the initial (control) response. However, PHFD was attenuated significantly more in RX821002-treated vs. sham rats (-3 +/- 3 bursts/min vs. -12 +/- 4 bursts/min @ 5 min post hypoxia for RX821002 and sham-treated, respectively; p < 0.05). We conclude that the magnitude of PHFD is dependent on the prior history of hypoxia and that alpha(2) adrenoreceptor activation plays a role in its underlying mechanism.

AB The key regulators of the transcriptional response to hypoxia and inflammation (hypoxia inducible factor, HIF, and nuclear factor-kappa B, NF-kappa B, respectively) are evolutionarily conserved and share significant crosstalk. Tissues often experience hypoxia and inflammation concurrently at the site of infection or injury due to fluid retention and immune cell recruitment that ultimately reduces the rate of oxygen delivery to tissues. Inflammation can induce activity of HIF-pathway genes, and hypoxia may modulate inflammatory signaling. While it is clear that these molecular pathways function in concert, the physiological consequences of hypoxia-induced inflammation and how hypoxia modulates inflammatory signaling and immune function are not well established. In this review, we summarize known mechanisms of HIF and NF-kappa B crosstalk and highlight the physiological consequences that can arise from maladaptive hypoxia-induced inflammation. Finally, we discuss what can be learned about adaptive regulation of inflammation under chronic hypoxia by examining adaptive and maladaptive inflammatory phenotypes observed in human populations at high altitude. We aim to provide insight into the time domains of hypoxia-induced inflammation and highlight the importance of hypoxia-induced inflammatory sensitization in immune function, pathologies, and environmental adaptation.

AB Objective-Angiogenic factors are expressed within thrombus during resolution, but the primary stimulus for neovascularization is unknown. Our aims were to determine whether (1) hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) are induced in resolving thrombus, (2) this stimulates angiogenic factor production, and (3) upregulating HIF1 alpha enhances thrombus resolution and vein recanalization.
   Methods and Results-Oxygen tension in the thrombus was negatively correlated with HIF1 alpha levels (Spearman correlation [RS] = -0.77, P < 0.0001), whereas HIF1 alpha levels positively correlated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression (Pearson correlation [R] = 0.85, P < 0.0005), during resolution in a murine model. HIF1 alpha (P < 0.005), VEGF (P < 0.005), and VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) (P < 0.05) expression was 2-fold greater in the thrombus of mice treated with the prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitor L-mimosine compared with controls. The levels of 13 other HIF1-mediated angiogenic factors were also increased. Thrombus weight (P < 0.001) and volume (P < 0.05) were reduced by a third in L-mimosine-treated mice compared with controls, whereas vein recanalization (P < 0.005) and thrombus neovascularization (P < 0.001) were 2-fold greater, and this was associated with increased inflammatory cell content.
   Conclusion-Hypoxia and HIF1 alpha are induced in the naturally resolving thrombus and correlate with increased angiogenic factor expression. Upregulation of HIF1 alpha enhances thrombus resolution and vein recanalization. HIF1 alpha may represent a novel target for treatments that promote resolution and recanalization and reduce the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome.

DT Review
DE hypoxia; lung; pathology; HIF
AB The lung is both the conduit for oxygen uptake and is also affected by hypoxia and hypoxia signaling. Decreased ventilatory drive, airway obstructive processes, intra-alveolar exudates, septal thickening by edema, inflammation, fibrosis, or damage to alveolar capillaries will all interpose a significant and potentially life-threatening barrier to proper oxygenation, therefore enhancing the alveolar/arterial pO(2) gradient. These processes result in decreased blood and tissue oxygenation. This review addresses the relationship of hypoxia with lung development and with lung diseases. We particularly focus on molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia-driven physiological and pathophysiological lung processes, specifically in the infant lung, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

AB Oxygen plays an important role in life activities and provides an important source of energy for aerobic organisms. Insufficient oxygen supply will lead to tissue hypoxia. Hypoxia is often closely related to inflammation, chronic wounds,tumors and other diseases,and tissue oxygen concentration is also an important basis for evaluating body health. The enormous advantages of optical imaging in terms of spatial resolution,sensitivity and cost-effectiveness make it an important imaging diagnostic tool for inflammation,cancer,brain diseases,and surgical navigation. In this review,we introduce the synthesis strategies of several hypoxia-responsive optical probes and illustrate the applications of different hypoxia optical probes in tumor detection,inflammation monitoring,wound oxygen content imaging,treatment response monitoring and food packaging. Finally,we discussed the application prospect of hypoxia optical imaging.

AB Tumor hypoxia is a hallmark of solid malignant tumor growth, profoundly influences malignant progression and contributes to the development of therapeutic resistance. Pathogenesis of tumor hypoxia is multifactorial, with contributions from both acute and chronic factors. Spatial distribution of hypoxia within tumors is markedly heterogeneous and often changes over time, e.g., during a course of radiotherapy. Substantial changes in the oxygenation status can occur within the distance of a few cell layers, explaining the inability of currently used molecular imaging techniques to adequately assess this crucial trait. Due to the possible importance of tumor hypoxia for clinical decision-making, there is a great demand for molecular tools which may provide the necessary resolution down to the single cell level. Exogenous and endogenous markers of tumor hypoxia have been investigated for this purpose. Their potential use may be greatly enhanced by multiparametric in situ methods in experimental and human tumor tissue.

AB This review mainly focuses on our understanding of spermatogenesis in physiological and pathological hypoxic condition. Real hypoxia is closely related to vascular changes and an increase in testicular temperature. Both induce a reduction in sperm count and can be related to the increase in germ cell apoptosis. On the other hand, change in the temperature, and oxygen levels in the microenvironment have influence on spermatogonial stem cell function and differentiation. The initial connection between hypoxia and a factor critical for stem cell maintenance is alteration in Oct-4 expression, and these data may be a useful strategy for modulating stem cell function. Unilateral testicular ischemia-induced cell death can be accompanied by an increase in germ cell apoptosis in the contralateral testis. The injury of contralateral testis following unilateral testicular damage is controversial, and it can contribute to the reduction in fertility.

AB We determined the effects of chronic exposure to intermittent hypoxia (CIH) on chemoreflex control of ventilation in conscious animals. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to CIH [nadir oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), 75%; 15 events/h; 10 h/day] or normoxia (NORM) for 21 days. We assessed the following responses to acute, graded hypoxia before and after exposures: ventilation ((V) over dotE, via barometric plethysmography), (V) over dotO(2) and (V) over dotCO(2) (analysis of expired air), heart rate (HR), and SpO(2) (pulse oximetry via neck collar). We quantified hypoxia-induced chemoreceptor sensitivity by calculating the stimulus-response relationship between SpO(2) and the ventilatory equivalent for (V) over dotCO(2) (linear regression). An additional aim was to determine whether CIH causes proliferation of carotid body glomus cells (using bromodeoxyuridine). CIH exposure increased the slope of the (V) over dotE/(V) over dotCO(2)/SpO(2) relationship and caused hyperventilation in normoxia. Bromodeoxyuridine staining was comparable in CIH and NORM. Thus our CIH paradigm augmented hypoxic chemosensitivity without causing glomus cell proliferation.

AB Hypoxia and hypoxia signalling through the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), play an important role in normal tissue repair processes. Tissue injury generally produces at least the transient loss of normal vascular perfusion and the resulting hypoxia induces the expression of many genes that allow the tissue to adapt to hypoxia, to start the repair process and, in time, to re-establish oxygen delivery to the tissue. In most cases, transient hypoxia and the activation of the HIF-1 pathway are beneficial and promote the repair process, producing tissue that might not perfectly reform its original architecture but that has its function substantially restored. However, in some cases of chronic injury, chronic hypoxia and pathological repair, the hypoxia pathway might be responsible for driving the process of fibrosis and can lead to excessive scarring and compromised organ function.

TI Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α deletion in myeloid lineage

AB Hypoxemia is seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction worsens their clinical condition. However, vasoconstriction is not the only aspect through which hypoxia induces the progression to pulmonary hypertension. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is a transcription factor responding to hypoxic conditions by regulating hundreds of genes involved in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, inflammation, and proliferation. We sought to determine the contribution of HIF-1 alpha in myeloid lineage cells to the pulmonary vascular response to chronic exposure to hypoxia. We generated myeloid-specific HIF-1 alpha knockout (MyeHIF1KO) mice by using Cre-lox P system, and exposed them to hypoxic conditions for 3 weeks to induce pulmonary hypertension. Macrophages from MyeHIF1KO and control mice were used for western blotting, RT-qPCR, chemotaxis assay, and ATP assay. MyeHIF1KO mice exposed to hypoxia for 3 weeks exhibited a significant reduction in the right ventricular systolic pressure accompanied by a decrease in the ratio of the right ventricular weight to left ventricular weight, muscularization of the small pulmonary arteries, and infiltration of macrophages into the lung and right ventricle compared with control mice. HIF-1 alpha-deficient peritoneal macrophages showed less migration toward monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and a decrease in intracellular ATP levels. These results indicate that HIF-1 alpha in macrophages contributes to the progression of pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension induced by chronic exposure to hypoxic conditions. The inhibition of myeloid-specific HIF-1 alpha may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.

AB Notch signaling is involved in cell fate determination and deregulated in human solid tumors. Hypoxia is an important feature in many solid tumors, which activates hypoxia-induced factors (HIFs) and their downstream targets to promote tumorigenesis and cancer development. Recently, HIFs have been shown to trigger the Notch signaling pathway in a variety of organisms and tissues. In this review, we focus on the pro- and anti-tumorigenic functions of Notch signaling and discuss the crosstalk between Notch signaling and cellular hypoxic response in cancer pathogenesis, including epithelia-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and the maintenance of cancer stem cells. The pharmacological strategies targeting Notch signaling and hypoxia in cancer are also discussed in this review.

AB Marine heatwave (MHW) can increase heat exchange between the land and the ocean, which may further develop into a consecutive marine and terrestrial heatwave (CMTHW). Despite their significance, the feedback mechanisms underlying these compound events remain inadequately understood. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between terrestrial and marine heatwaves across China's coastal regions, leveraging multiple temperature datasets. Our findings reveal a marked increase in both the frequency and spatial extent of CMTHWs over the past four decades. Notably, longer lasting and more intense MHWs are more likely to trigger subsequent terrestrial heatwaves (THWs), indicating that CMTHWs are associated with more severe and prolonged MHWs compared to standalone MHWs. Atmospheric processes cause additional land surface warming relative to the ocean. Specifically, during CMTHWs, land surface latent heat flux anomalies are significantly larger than those over the ocean, highlighting the critical role of atmospheric feedback. These findings underscore the need for further investigation into the mechanisms linking marine and terrestrial heatwaves and the broader implications for coastal climate dynamics and ecosystem resilience.

AB Tumor hypoxia, or the condition of low oxygen, is a key factor for tumor progression and treatment resistance. Because hypoxic tumor cells are more resistant to ionizing radiation, hypoxia has been a focus of clinical research in radiation therapy for half a century. During this period, interest in targeting tumor hypoxia has waxed and waned as promising treatments emerged from the laboratory, only to fail in the clinics. With the development of new radiation targeting strategies, specifically intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and image guidance technologies (image-guided RT; IGRT), there is a strong interest in imaging hypoxia for radiation targeting and dose escalation. In this review, we will discuss the role of hypoxia imaging, specifically positron emission tomography (PET)-based imaging with hypoxia-specific tracers, for directing radiation treatment in solid tumors.

AB Severe hypoxia induces seizures, which reduces ventilation and worsens the ictal state. It is a health threat to patients, particularly those with underlying hypoxic respiratory pathologies, which may be conducive to a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Recent studies provide evidence that brain microglia are involved with both respiratory and ictal processes. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that microglia could interact with hypoxia-induced seizures. To this end, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) and acute ventilatory responses to hypoxia (5% O-2 in N-2) in conscious, spontaneously breathing adult mice. We compared control vehicle pre-treated animals with those pre-treated with minocycline, an inhibitory modulator of microglial activation. First, we histologically confirmed that hypoxia activates microglia and that pre-treatment with minocycline blocks hypoxia-induced microglial activation. Then, we analyzed the effects of minocycline pre-treatment on ventilatory responses to hypoxia by plethysmography. Minocycline alone failed to affect respiratory variables in room air or the initial respiratory augmentation in hypoxia. The comparative results showed that hypoxia caused seizures, which were accompanied by the late phase ventilatory suppression in all but one minocycline pre-treated mouse. Compared to the vehicle pre-treated, the minocycline pre-treated mice showed a delayed occurrence of seizures. Further, minocycline pre-treated mice tended to resist post-ictal respiratory arrest. These results suggest that microglia are conducive to seizure activity in severe hypoxia. Thus, inhibition of microglial activation may help suppress or prevent hypoxia-induced ictal episodes.

AB Ferroptosis is an oxidative damage-related, iron-dependent regulated cell death with intracellular lipid peroxide accumulation, which is associated with many physiological and pathological processes. It exhibits unique features that are morphologically, biochemically, and immunologically distinct from other regulated cell death forms. Ferroptosis is regulated by iron metabolism, lipid metabolism, anti-oxidant defense systems, as well as various signal pathways. Hypoxia, which is found in a group of physiological and pathological conditions, can affect multiple cellular functions by activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling and other mechanisms. Emerging evidence demonstrated that hypoxia regulates ferroptosis in certain cell types and conditions. In this review, we summarize the basic mechanisms and regulations of ferroptosis and hypoxia, as well as the regulation of ferroptosis by hypoxia in physiological and pathological conditions, which may contribute to the numerous diseases therapies.

TI NDRG3-mediated lactate signaling in hypoxia

LA English
DT Article
DE Hypoxia; Lactate signaling; NDRG3; HIF-independent hypoxia responses;
   PHD2/VHL pathway
AB Hypoxia is associated with many pathological conditions as well as the normal physiology of metazoans. We identified a lactate-dependent signaling pathway in hypoxia, mediated by the oxygen-and lactate-regulated protein NDRG family member 3 (NDRG3). Oxygen negatively regulates NDRG3 expression at the protein level via the PHD2/VHL system, whereas lactate, produced in excess under prolonged hypoxia, blocks its proteasomal degradation by binding to NDRG3. We also found that the stabilized NDRG3 protein promotes angiogenesis and cell growth under hypoxia by activating the Raf-ERK pathway. Inhibiting cellular lactate production abolishes NDRG3-mediated hypoxia responses. The NDRG3-Raf-ERK axis therefore provides the genetic basis for lactate-induced hypoxia signaling, which can be exploited for the development of therapies targeting hypoxia-induced diseases in addition to advancing our understanding of the normal physiology of hypoxia responses.

AB Regulation of tissue oxygen homeostasis is critical for cell function, proliferation and survival. Evidence for this continues to accumulate along with our understanding of the complex oxygen-sensing pathways present within cells. Several pathophysiological disorders are associated with a loss in oxygen homeostasis, including heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The microenvironment of tumors in particular is very oxygen heterogeneous, which may explain much of our difficulty in treating cancer effectively. This is true when comparing levels of hypoxia among different patient tumors, but also within individual tumors. Accumulating evidence implicates the biological responses to hypoxia and the alterations in these pathways in cancer as important contributors to overall malignancy and treatment efficacy. This has recently prompted several investigations into the possibility of targeting treatment at the biological responses to hypoxia. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hypoxia has been the subject of research within the radiotherapy community for many years. Until relatively recently, reliable methods to measure hypoxia were unavailable. However since the 1990's, a series of different methodologies have been developed which have allowed large-scale studies of the prognostic significance of this tumor-associated process. Within the same time-frame biological knowledge concerning hypoxia has dramatically increased and a paradigm shift has taken place in current thinking concerning the role of hypoxia not only in treatment resistance but also as a driving force in malignant progression and continued tumor growth. This review discusses the current view of hypoxia, the methods available to measure hypoxia and the prognostic information that has been attained.

AB Previous reports have suggested that the hypoxic microenvironment provides a niche that supports tumor stem cells, and that this might explain clinical observations linking hypoxia to metastasis. To test this, we examined the effects of a hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, on the tumor-initiating cell (TIC) frequency of patient-derived pancreatic xenografts (PDX).
   The frequencies of TIC, measured by limiting dilution assay, varied widely in 11 PDX models, and were correlated with rapid growth but not with the levels of hypoxia. Treatment with either TH-302 or ionizing radiation (IR), to target hypoxic and well-oxygenated regions, respectively, reduced TIC frequency, and the combination of TH-302 and IR was much more effective in all models tested. The combination was also more effective than TH-302 or IR alone controlling tumor growth, particularly treating the more rapidly-growing/hypoxic models. These findings support the clinical utility of hypoxia targeting in combination with radiotherapy to treat pancreatic cancers, but do not provide strong evidence for a hypoxic stem cell niche.

TI Normobaric hypoxia overnight impairs cognitive reaction time
SO BMC NEUROSCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Reaction time; Hypoxia; Cognition; Sleep; Extreme altitude
ID HIGH-ALTITUDE; SLEEP
AB Background: Impaired reaction time in patients suffering from hypoxia during sleep, caused by sleep breathing disorders, is a well-described phenomenon. High altitude sleep is known to induce periodic breathing with central apneas and oxygen desaturations, even in perfectly healthy subjects. However, deficits in reaction time in mountaineers or workers after just some nights of hypoxia exposure are not sufficiently explored. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of sleep in a normobaric hypoxic environment on reaction time divided by its cognitive and motoric components. Eleven healthy non acclimatized students (5f, 6m, 21 +/- 2.1 years) slept one night at a simulated altitude of 3500 m in a normobaric hypoxic room, followed by a night with polysomnography at simulated 5500 m. Preexisting sleep disorders were excluded via BERLIN questionnaire. All subjects performed a choice reaction test (SCHUHFRIED RT, S3) at 450 m and directly after the nights at simulated 3500 and 5500 m.
   Results: We found a significant increase of cognitive reaction time with higher altitude (p = 0.026). No changes were detected in movement time (p = n.s.). Reaction time, the combined parameter of cognitive-and motoric reaction time, didn't change either (p = n.s.). Lower SpO(2) surprisingly correlated significantly with shorter cognitive reaction time (r = 0.78, p = 0.004). Sleep stage distribution and arousals at 5500 m didn't correlate with reaction time, cognitive reaction time or movement time.
   Conclusion: Sleep in hypoxia does not seem to affect reaction time to simple tasks. The component of cognitive reaction time is increasingly delayed whereas motoric reaction time seems not to be affected. Low SpO(2) and arousals are not related to increased cognitive reaction time therefore the causality remains unclear. The fact of increased cognitive reaction time after sleep in hypoxia, considering high altitude workers and mountaineering operations with overnight stays, should be further investigated.

AB Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are the key regulators of oxygen homeostasis in response to hypoxia. In diabetes, multiple tissues are hypoxic but adaptive responses to hypoxia are impaired due to insufficient activation of HIF signalling, which results from inhibition of HIF-1 alpha stability and function due to hyperglycaemia and elevated fatty acid levels. In this review, we will summarise and discuss current findings about the regulation of HIF signalling in diabetes and the pathogenic roles of hypoxia and dysregulated HIF signalling in the development of diabetes and its complications. The therapeutic potential of targeting HIF signalling for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and related complications is also discussed.

   IMPACTS
AB Hypoxia is one of the common effects of eutrophication in coastal marine ecosystems and is becoming an increasingly prevalent problem worldwide. The causes of hypoxia are associated with excess nutrient inputs from both point and non-point sources, although the response of coastal marine ecosystems is strongly modulated by physical processes such as stratification and mixing. Changes in climate, particularly temperature, may also affect the susceptibility of coastal marine ecosystems to hypoxia. Hypoxia is a particularly severe disturbance because it causes death of biota and catastrophic changes in the ecosystem. Bottom water oxygen deficiency not only influences the habitat of living resources but also the biogeochemical processes that control nutrient concentrations in the water column. Increased phosphorus fluxes from sediments into overlying waters occur with hypoxia. In addition, reductions in the ability of ecosystems to remove nitrogen through denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation may be related to hypoxia and could lead to acceleration in the rate of eutrophication. Three large coastal marine ecosystems (Chesapeake Bay, Northern Gulf of Mexico, and Danish Straits) all demonstrate thresholds whereby repeated hypoxic events have led to an increase in susceptibility of further hypoxia and accelerated eutrophication. Once hypoxia occurs, reoccurrence is likely and may be difficult to reverse. Therefore, elucidating ecosystem thresholds of hypoxia and linking them to nutrient inputs are necessary for the management of coastal marine ecosystems. Finally, projected increases in warming show an increase in the susceptibility of coastal marine ecosystems to hypoxia such that hypoxia will expand.

AB Both tumor hypoxia and dysregulated metabolism are classical features of cancer. Recent analyses have revealed complex interconnections between oncogenic activation, hypoxia signaling systems and metabolic pathways that are dysregulated in cancer. These studies have demonstrated that rather than responding simply to error signals arising from energy depletion or tumor hypoxia, metabolic and hypoxia signaling pathways are also directly connected to oncogenic signaling mechanisms at many points. This review will summarize current understanding of the role of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) in these networks. It will also discuss the role of these interconnected pathways in generating the cancer phenotype; in particular, the implications of switching massive pathways that are physiologically 'hard-wired' to oncogenic mechanisms driving cancer.

AB Low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) have been reported in solid tumours. This hypoxic microenvironment modulates the expression of genes linked to a more aggressive disease. However, it is unclear if the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes as cytochromes P450 (CYPs) is affected by hypoxia in cancer. We aimed to define which cytochromes are affected by hypoxia using a liver cancer model in vitro. For this purpose, we assessed whole-genome expression microarrays of HepG2 liver cancer cell line from free repository databases, looking for gene expression hypoxia-associated profiles and selected those cytochromes with significant differences. Then, we corroborated their mRNA expression and protein levels by RT-qPCR and western blot, respectively, as well as immunofluorescence. Based on microarray analysis, we found that the expression of CYP2S1 and CYP24A1 were up-regulated with at least twice fold change compared with normoxia. The levels of mRNA and protein of CYP2S1 and CYP24A1 were increased significantly in hypoxic conditions (P < .05), and this tendency was also observed by immunofluorescence assays. Our data show that the expression of cytochromes CYP2S1 and CYP24A1 are induced in hypoxia, being the first time that CYP24A1 expression is associated with tumour hypoxia; which might have consequences in cancer progression and drug resistance.
   Significance of the study Hypoxia is among the most important factors for cellular adaptation to stress. Especially in cancer, a major public health issue, hypoxia plays a substantial role in angiogenesis, metastasis and resistance to therapy. Tumoral hypoxia has been described at least in the brain, breast, cervical, liver, renal, lung, pancreatic and renal cancer. However, the understanding of how hypoxia drives cancer progression is still a major challenge. One emerging question is the role of hypoxia over the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes, with a significant impact on drug treatment. In this context, our paper focus on the effect of hypoxia on CYPs, which is an essential group of drug-metabolizing enzymes. We show that hypoxia induces the expression of two members of the CYPs family: CYP2S1 and CYP24A1. Importantly, CYP2S1 is a major metabolizer of carcinogenic substances being relevant that hypoxia could promote this function. Interestingly, CYP24A1 limits the action of the active form of vitamin D, which is an anti-proliferative factor in cancer. Our evidence shows for the first time that hypoxia can induce CYP24A1 expression, with a potential effect on cancer progression. Our contribution clarifies a particular effect of tumoral hypoxia and the implications will be useful in the understanding of the progression of cancer, the resistance to treatment and the development of alternative therapies.

AB Hypoxia, a common feature of solid tumors, greatly hinders the efficacy of conventional cancer treatments such as chemo-, radio-, and immunotherapy. The depletion of oxygen in proliferating and advanced tumors causes an array of genetic, transcriptional, and metabolic adaptations that promote survival, metastasis, and a clinically malignant phenotype. At the nexus of these interconnected pathways are hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) which orchestrate transcriptional responses under hypoxia. The following review summarizes current literature regarding effects of hypoxia on DNA repair, metastasis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the cancer stem cell phenotype, and therapy resistance. We also discuss mechanisms and pathways, such as HIF signaling, mitochondrial dynamics, exosomes, and the unfolded protein response, that contribute to hypoxia-induced phenotypic changes. Finally, novel therapeutics that target the hypoxic tumor microenvironment or interfere with hypoxia-induced pathways are reviewed.

AB When oxygen demand is greater than oxygen supply, cells need to rapidly adjust their metabolism in order for the tissue to survive. Oxygen sensing by an organism influences a host of processes including growth, development, metabolism, pH homeostasis, and angiogenesis. Hypoxia also contributes to a wide number of human diseases including vascular disease, inflammatory conditions and cancer. Recently, major advances have been made in understanding the response of cells and tissues to hypoxia with the goal of providing mechanistic insight and novel therapeutic targets. In this article we review both the normal biological effects of hypoxia as well as the alterations that occur in specific disease conditions with an emphasis on the cell signaling and gene transcription mechanisms that underlie the changes associated with chronic hypoxia. Comparisons of studies in the fields of cardiac ischemia and tumor angiogenesis reveal the complexities within the microenvironment that control responses to hypoxia. It is clear that more interaction between researchers in these fields will improve the development of therapies that either promote or prevent hypoxic responses. J. Cell. Biochem. 112: 735-744, 2011.

AB This study investigated the human erythropoietin (EPO) response to short-term hypocapnic hypoxia, its relationship to a normoxic or hypoxic increase of the haemoglobin oxygen affinity, and its suppression by the addition of CO2 to the hypoxic gas. On separate days, eight healthy male subjects were exposed to 2 h each of hypocapnic hypoxia, normocapnic hypoxia, hypocapnic normoxia, and normal breathing of room air (control experiment). During the control experiment, serum-EPO showed significant variations (ANOVA P = 0.047) with a 15% increase in mean values, The serum-EPO measured in the other experiments were corrected for these spontaneous variations in each individual. At 2 h after ending hypocapnic hypoxia (10% O-2 in nitrogen), mean serum-EPO increased by 28% [baseline 8.00 (SEM 0.84) U . l(-1), post-hypoxia 10.24 (SEM 0.95) U . l(-1), P = 0.005]. Normocapnic hypoxia was produced by the addition of CO2 (10% Co-2 with 10% O-2) to the hypoxic gas mixture. This elicited an increased ventilation, unaltered arterial pH and haemoglobin oxygen affinity, a lower degree of hypoxia than during hypocapnic hypoxia, and no significant changes in serum-EPO (ANOVA P > 0.05), Hypocapnic normoxia, produced by hyperventilation of room air, elicited a normoxic increase in the haemoglobin oxygen affinity without changing serum-EPO. Among the measured blood gas and acid-base parameters, only the partial pressures of oxygen in arterial blood during hypocapnic hypoxia were related to the peak values of serum-EPO (r = -0.81, P = 0.01). The present human EPO responses to hypoxia were lower than those which have previously been reported in rodents and humans. In contrast with the earlier rodent studies, it was found that human EPO production could not be triggered by short-term increases in pH and haemoglobin oxygen affinity per se, and the human EPO response to hypoxia could be suppressed by concomitant normocapnia without acidosis.

AB Cells respond to hypoxia by shifting cellular processes from general housekeeping functions to activating specialized hypoxia-response pathways. Oxygen plays an important role in generating ATP to maintain a productive rate of protein synthesis in normoxia. In hypoxia, the rate of the canonical protein synthesis pathway is significantly slowed and impaired due to limited ATP availability, necessitating an alternative mechanism to mediate protein synthesis and facilitate adaptation. Hypoxia adaptation is largely mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). While HIFs are well known for their transcriptional functions, they also play imperative roles in translation to mediate hypoxic protein synthesis. Such adaptations to hypoxia are often hyperactive in solid tumors, contributing to the expression of cancer hallmarks, including treatment resistance. The current literature on protein synthesis in hypoxia is reviewed here, inclusive of hypoxia-specific mRNA selection to translation termination. Current HIF targeting therapies are also discussed as are the opportunities involved with targeting hypoxia specific protein synthesis pathways.

AB Eukaryotic chromatin is subject to multiple posttranslational histone modifications such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. These various covalent modifications have been proposed to constitute a "histone code," playing important roles in the establishment of global chromatin environments, transcription, DNA repair, and DNA replication. Among these modifications, histone methylation specifies regulatory marks that delineate transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin. These histone methyl marks were considered irreversible; however, recent identification of site-specific histone demethylases demonstrates that histone methylation is dynamically regulated, which may allow cells to rapidly change chromatin conformation to adapt to environmental stresses or intrinsic stimuli. Of major interest is the observation that these histone demethylase enzymes, which are in the Jumonji gene family, require oxygen to function and, in some cases, are induced by hypoxia in an HIF alpha-dependent manner. This provides a new mechanism for regulation of the response to hypoxia.

AB Pancreatic cancers are thought to be unusually hypoxic, which might sensitize them to drugs that are activated under hypoxic conditions. In order to develop this idea in the clinic, a minimally invasive technique for measuring the oxygenation status of pancreatic cancers is needed. Methods: We tested the potential for minimally invasive imaging of hypoxia in pancreatic cancer patients, using the 2-nitroimidazole PET tracer F-18-fluoroazomycin arabinoside (or F-18-1-alpha-D-fluoro-5-deoxyarabinofuranosyl]-2-nitroimidazole [F-18-FAZA]). Dynamic and static scans were obtained in 21 patients with either locally advanced or metastatic disease. The hypoxic fraction was determined in the 2-h static scans as the percentage of voxels with SUVs more than 3 SDs from the mean values obtained for skeletal muscle. Results: Hypoxia was detected in 15 of 20 evaluable patients, with the hypoxic fraction ranging from less than 5% to greater than 50%. Compartmental analysis of the dynamic scans allowed us to approximate the tumor perfusion as mL/min/g of tissue, a value that is independent of the extent of hypoxia derived from tracer uptake in the 2-h static scan. There was no significant correlation between tumor perfusion and hypoxia; nor did we see an association between tumor volume and hypoxia. Conclusion: Although pancreatic cancers can be highly hypoxic, a substantial proportion appears to be well oxygenated. Therefore, we suggest that a minimally invasive technique such as the one described in this study be used for patient stratification in future clinical trials of hypoxia-targeting agents.

AB Hypoxia controls metabolism at several levels, e.g., via mitochondrial ATP production, glucose uptake and glycolysis. Hence it is likely that hypoxia also affects the action and/or production of many peptide hormones linked to food intake and appetite control. Many of those are produced in the gastrointestinal tract, endocrine pancreas, adipose tissue, and selective areas in the brain which modulate and concert their actions. However, the complexity of the hypoxia response and the links to peptides/hormones involved in food intake and appetite control in the different organs are not well known. This review summarizes the role of the hypoxia response and its effects on major peptides linked to appetite regulation, nutrition and metabolism.

AB Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has drawn great interest in recent years mainly due to its low side effects and few drug resistances. Nevertheless, one of the issues of PDT is the need for oxygen to induce a photodynamic effect. Tumours often have low oxygen concentrations, related to the abnormal structure of the microvessels leading to an ineffective blood distribution. Moreover, PDT consumes O-2. In order to improve the oxygenation of tumour or decrease hypoxia, different strategies are developed and are described in this review: (1) The use of O-2 vehicle; (2) the modification of the tumour microenvironment (TME); (3) combining other therapies with PDT; (4) hypoxia-independent PDT; (5) hypoxia-dependent PDT and (6) fractional PDT.

AB Cerebrovascular microcirculation is essential for maintaining the physiological functions of the brain. The brain can be protected from stress injury by remodeling the microcirculation network. Angiogenesis is a type of cerebral vascular remodeling. It is an effective approach to improve the blood flow of the cerebral microcirculation, which is necessary for preventing and treating various neurological disorders. Hypoxia is one of the most important regulators of angiogenesis, affecting the sprouting, proliferation, and maturation stages of angiogenesis. Moreover, hypoxia negatively affects cerebral vascular tissue by impairing the structural and functional integrity of the blood-brain barrier and vascular-nerve decoupling. Therefore, hypoxia has a dual effect on blood vessels and is affected by confounding factors including oxygen concentration, hypoxia duration, and hypoxia frequency and extent. Establishing an optimal model that promotes cerebral microvasculogenesis without causing vascular injury is essential. In this review, we first elaborate on the effects of hypoxia on blood vessels from two different perspectives: (1) the promotion of angiogenesis and (2) cerebral microcirculation damage. We further discuss the factors influencing the dual role of hypoxia and emphasize the benefits of moderate hypoxic irritation and its potential application as an easy, safe, and effective treatment for multiple nervous system disorders.

AB Purpose: Previous research has evaluated the effects of acute hypoxia exposure on cognitive function, notably executive function. No studies, to date, have evaluated the effects of acute hypoxia exposure on memory interference, which was the purpose of this experiment. Methods: A within-subjects, counterbalanced experimental design was employed, with condition (hypoxia vs. normoxia) and time (immediate vs. delayed) being the independent variables. Participants (N = 21; M-age = 21.0 years) completed two laboratory visits, involving 30 min of exposure to either hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.12) or normoxia (FIO2 = 0.21). Following this, they completed a memory interference task (AB/AC paradigm), assessing immediate and delayed proactive and retroactive interference. Results: For retroactive interference, we observed a significant main effect for condition, F(1, 20) = 5.48, p = 0.03, eta(2) = 0.10, condition by time interaction, F(1, 20) = 4.96, p = 0.03, eta(2) = 0.01, but no main effect for time, F(1, 20) = 1.75, p = 0.20, eta(2) = 0.004. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that acute hypoxia exposure was facilitative in reducing memory interference. We discuss these findings in the context of the potential therapeutic effects of acute hypoxia exposure on synaptic plasticity.

AB In some regions of the hippocampus, neurogenesis persists throughout life and is upregulated following hypoxia/ischemia. The mechanisms underlying the upregulation of neurogenesis, however, are not known. Here we examined the expression of two factors thought to be involved in hypoxiarelated neurogenesis, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and brain-derived erythropoietin (EPO), in the hippocampus of neonatal rats following hypoxia-ischemia. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed to hypoxia-ischemia conditions or hypoxia conditions only. For the hypoxia-ischemia experiment, the left common carotid artery of Sprague-Dawley rat pups was ligated on postnatal day 7. The pups were exposed to hypoxic conditions and then returned to normoxia for re-oxygenation. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate EPO and HIF-1 alpha expression at various time points after re-oxygenation (1 h, 6 h, 16 h, 1 d, 3 d, and 7 d). EPO expression in the hippocampus was verified using Western blot studies. For the hypoxia-only experiment, postnatal day 7 rat pups were continuously exposed to hypoxic conditions for different durations (0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 5 h). HIF-1 alpha expression in the hippocampus was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. In the hypoxia-ischemia group, EPO expression was significantly altered. The EPO expression increased during re-oxygenation, peaked at 16 h, and decreased thereafter. In the hypoxia-only group, the EPO protein was not detectable. When the rat pups were returned to normoxia for re-oxygenation, there was no HIF-1 alpha expression. HIF-1 alpha immunoreactivity was present in the hypoxia-only group and peaked in rats exposed to continuous hypoxic conditions for 3 h. In addition, endogenous EPO increased in the neonatal rats after the hypoxia-ischemia event. Furthermore, HIF-1 alpha was induced as a result of hypoxia. We postulate that disruption of homeostasis triggers and enhances hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, HIF-1 alpha/EPO hypoxic signal transduction may initiate hippocampal neurogenesis following hypoxia-ischemia.

DT Review
DE hypoxia-inducible factor-1; inflammation; oxygen
AB In obesity, dysregulated metabolism and aberrant expansion of adipose tissue lead to the development of tissue hypoxia that plays an important role in contributing to obesity-associated metabolic disorders. Recent studies utilizing adipocyte-specific hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha) gain-or loss-of-function animal models highlight the pivotal involvement of hypoxic responses in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance. HIF-1 alpha, a master transcription factor of oxygen homeostasis, induces inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity, whereas its isoform, HIF-2 alpha, exerts opposing functions in these obesity associated metabolic phenotypes. In this review, recent evidence elucidating functional implications of adipocyte HIFs in obesity and, more importantly, how these regulate obesity-associated inflammation, fibrosis, and insulin resistance will be discussed. Further, we propose that modulation of HIF-1 could be a potential novel therapeutic strategy for antidiabetic treatment.

AB Background and purpose:. A 15-gene hypoxia profile has previously demonstrated to have both prognostic and predictive impact for hypoxic modification in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This gene expression profile may also have a prognostic value in other histological cancer types, and could potentially have a function as a universal hypoxia profile. The hypoxia induced upregulation of the included genes, and the validity of the previously used reference genes was established in this study, in a range of different cell lines representing carcinomas of the prostate, colon, and esophagus.
   Materials and methods: Eleven adenocarcinoma and one squamous cell lines: Six colon carcinomas (HTC8, HT29, LS174T, SW116, SW948 and T48), 3 prostate carcinomas (LNCaP, DU-145 and PC-3) and 3 esophagus carcinoma cell lines (OE19, OE21 and OE33) were cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions (0% O-2) for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted and gene expression levels. measured by qPCR. For each tissue type, individual reference genes were selected and applied in the normalization of the relative expression levels.
   Results: In all three tissue types, individual, optimal, reference genes were selected. In the analysis of the hypoxia induced genes, both the original reference genes and the new selected reference genes were used. There was no significant difference in the obtained data. The gene expression analysis demonstrated cell line specific differences in the hypoxia response of the 15 genes, with BNIP3 not being upregulated at hypoxic conditiOns in 3 out of 6 colon cancer cell lines, and ALDOA in OE21 and FAM162A and SLC2A1 in SW116 only showing limited hypoxia induction. Furthermore, in the esophagus cell lines, the normoxic and hypoxic expression levels of LOX and BNIP3 were below the detection limit in OE19 and OE33, respectively. However, a combined analysis. of the 15 genes in both adenocarcinoma cell lines and squamous carcinoma cell lines demonstrated a very consistent expression pattern in hypoxic induced gene expression across all cell lines.
   Conclusion: This study addressed the tissue type dependency of hypoxia induced genes included in a 15-gene hypoxic profile in carcinoma cell lines from prostate, colon, and esophagus cancer, and demonstrated that in vitro, with minor fluctuations, the genes in the hypoxic profile are hypoxia inducible, and the hypoxia profile may be applicable in other, sites than HNSCC.

AB Hypoxic head and neck tumors respond poorly to radiotherapy and can be identified using gene expression profiles. However, it is unknown whether treatment outcome is driven by acute or chronic hypoxia. Gene expression data of 398 head and neck cancers was collected. Four clinical hypoxia profiles were compared to in vitro acute and chronic hypoxia profiles. Chronic and acute hypoxia profiles were tested for their association to outcome using Cox proportional hazard analyses. In an initial set of 224 patients, scores of the four clinical hypoxia profiles correlated with each other and with chronic hypoxia. However, the acute hypoxia profile showed a stronger association with local recurrence after chemoradiotherapy (p = 0.02; HR = 3.1) than the four clinical (chronic hypoxia) profiles (p = 0.2; HR = 0.9). An independent set of 174 patients confirmed that acute hypoxia is a stronger prognostic factor than chronic hypoxia for overall survival, progression-free survival, local and locoregional control. Multivariable analyses accounting for known prognostic factors substantiate this finding (p = 0.045; p = 0.042; p = 0.018 and p = 0.003, respectively). In conclusion, the four clinical hypoxia profiles are related to chronic hypoxia and not acute hypoxia. The acute hypoxia profile shows a stronger association with patient outcome and should be incorporated into existing prediction models.

AB Objectives: To investigate whether hypoxia has an effect on regulation of multidrug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapeutic drugs in laryngeal carcinoma cells and explore the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha). Methods: Laryngeal cancer cells were cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The sensitivity of the cells to multiple drugs and levels of apoptosis induced by paclitaxel were determined by MTT assay and annexin-V/propidium iodide staining analysis, respectively. HIF-1 alpha expression was blocked by RNA interference. The expression of HIF-1 alpha gene was detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. The value of fluorescence intensity of intracellular adriamycin accumulation and retention in cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. Results: The sensitivity to multiple chemotherapy agents and induction of apoptosis by paclitaxel could be reduced by hypoxia (P<0.05). A the same time, the adriamycin releasing index of cells was increased (P<0.05). However, resistance acquisition subject to hypoxia in vitro was suppressed by down-regulating HIF-1 alpha expression. Conclusion: HIF-1 alpha could be considered as a key regulator for mediating hypoxia-induced MDR in laryngeal cancer cells via inhibition of drug-induced apoptosis and decrease in intracellular drug accumulation.

AB Sustained hypoxia evokes a predictable cascade of ventilatory, neurochemical, and metabolic responses. Responses in immature animals are characterized by earlier and more marked depression of ventilation than fully mature animals. Ventilation during hypoxia reflects a collective system output, incorporating a number of compensatory mechanisms (stimulation or depression) from multiple systems. The time course of these responses is clearly developmentally regulated. When hypercapnia interacts with hypoxia, the ventilatory responses are enhanced but other responses are apparently unchanged. We propose a model in which responses to intermittent stimuli vary according to the point within the sequence of a single response where the stimulus interruption occurs. An intermittent stimulus may be seen as continuous' if the recurrence frequency exceeds a certain threshold, whereas application of slower cycles below such threshold may elicit discordant recruitment of the compensatory responses. Indeed, experimental observations on intermittent (hypercapnic or poikylocapnic) hypoxia show excitatory or depressant effects that are dictated by the cycle duration. Subject to further testing, this model may help explain how detrimental effects of hypoxic events in infancy only affect selected groups. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Prolonged ischemia used in liver surgery and/or transplantation causes cellular damage resulting in apoptosis and necrosis. Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) led Kupffer cells to pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin-1] which involve chemokines secretion by hepatocytes. These chemokines have neutrophil chemotactic properties and neutrophils are involved in the development of I/R-induced necrosis. The aim of this study was to specify the consequence of partial oxygen pressure variation on hepatocyte chemokines synthesis and to verify if intermittent hypoxia and/or preconditioning could decrease it. It was performed on primary cultured mice hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, subjected to continuous, intermittent hypoxia or preconditioning phases, mimicking surgical processes. The chemokine secretion was evaluated by RNase protection assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Only monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) mRNA formation were observed, especially after 1-h hypoxia followed by 10-h (for MCP-1) or 24-h reoxygenation (for MIP-2). In conclusion, TNF-alpha and coculture with Kupffer cells increased hepatocyte chemokines mRNA transcription, whereas surgical split up protocols (intermittent hypoxia and preconditioning) had no significant effect.

AB Hypoxia frequently occurs in aquatic environments, especially in aquaculture areas. However, research on the relationship between hypoxic aquatic environments with viral diseases outbreak is limited, and its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, we demonstrated that hypoxia directly triggers the outbreak of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) disease. Hypoxia or activated hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway could remarkably increase the levels of viral genomic DNA, titers, and gene expression, indicating that ISKNV can response to hypoxia and HIF pathway. To reveal the mechanism of ISKNV respond to HIF pathway, we identified the viral hypoxia response elements (HREs) in ISKNV genome. Fifteen viral HREs were identified, and four related viral genes responded to the HIF pathway, in which the hre-orf077r promoter remarkably responded to the HIF pathway. The level of orf077r mRNA dramatically increased after the infected cells were treated with dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) or the infected cells/fish subjected to hypoxic conditions, and overexpressed orf077r could remarkably increase the ISKNV replication. These finding shows that hypoxic aquatic environments induce the expression of viral genes through the viral HREs to promote ISKNV replication, indicating that viral HREs might be important biomarkers for the evaluation of the sensitivity of aquatic animal viral response to hypoxia stress. Furthermore, the frequencies of viral HREs in 43 species aquatic viral genomes from 16 families were predicted and the results indicate that some aquatic animal viruses, such as Picornavirdea, Dicistronviridae, and Herpesviridae, may have a high risk to outbreak when the aquatic environment encounters hypoxic stress.

AB Altitude hypoxia episodes are increasingly common in military aviation. Hypoxia training is mandatory for fighter pilots, but evidence-based data on the effects of training are scarce. The purpose of this study was to validate the normobaric hypoxia (NH) training effect. Data were collected from 89 pilots from the Finnish Air Force (FINAF). This survey was conducted in a tactical F/A-18C Hornet simulator in two sessions under normobaric conditions, in which the pilots performed flight missions and breathed 21% oxygen (O-2) in nitrogen (N-2), and blinded to the pilot, the breathing gas was changed to a hypoxic mixture containing either 8, 7 or 6% O-2 in N-2. The time taken to notice hypoxia symptoms and peripheral capillary O-2 saturation was measured. A mean of 2.4 years after the initial training, pilots recognised their hypoxic symptoms 18 s quicker with 8% O-2 mixture, 20 s quicker with 7% O-2 and 10 s quicker with 6% O-2. Our data indicate that NH training in a flight simulator helps pilots to recognise hypoxia symptoms earlier, and may, thus, enhance flight safety.
   Practitioner Summary: We show that hypoxia training enhances pilots' ability to recognise symptoms of acute normobaric hypoxic exposure up to 2.4 years after an initial NH training session. Based on these data, refreshment NH training is nowadays mandatory every 3 years in the FINAF as opposed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Standardisation Agreement (STANAG) requirement of 5-year intervals between hypoxia trainings.

AB Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged periods of exceptionally warm temperatures in the ocean, which have forced profound transformations in marine biodiversity and socio-economic systems globally over the last decades. The Mediterranean basin, a highly vulnerable area to climate change, has been particularly affected as a marginal sea, experiencing multifaceted changes due to these events. This literature review brings together a comprehensive list of interdisciplinary research on MHW evolution in the Mediterranean basin, from the past to the future, covering the most common driving mechanisms of MHWs, known feedbacks and impacts on various marine organisms and local economies. Aiming to enhance our understanding of Mediterranean MHWs across various dimensions, we further discuss ongoing challenges in their detection and characterization, highlighting the need to improve monitoring systems and forecasting capabilities using novel approaches in the basin and beyond.

AB Male reproductive functions, which include testicular steroidogenesis, spermatogenesis, and sexual/erectile functions are key in male fertility, but may be adversely altered by several factors, including hypoxia. This review demonstrates the impact of hypoxia on male reproductive functions. Acute exposure to hypoxia promotes testosterone production via stimulation of autophagy and upregulation of steroidogenic enzymes and voltage-gated L-type calcium channel, nonetheless, chronic exposure to hypoxia impairs steroidogenesis via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. Also, hypoxia distorts spermatogenesis and reduces sperm count, motility, and normal forms via upregulation of VEGF and oxidative stress-sensitive signaling. Furthermore, hypoxia induces sexual and erectile dysfunction via a testosterone-dependent downregulation of NO/cGMP signaling and upregulation of PGE1/TGF beta 1-driven penile endothelial dysfunction. Notably, hypoxia programs male sexual function and spermatogenesis/sperm quality via feminization and demasculinization of males and oxidative stress-mediated alteration in sperm DNA methylation. Since oxidative stress plays a central role in hypoxia-induced male reproductive dysfunction, studies exploring the effects of antioxidants and upregulation of transcription of antioxidants on hypoxia-induced male reproductive dysfunction are recommended.

AB Previous psychophysical studies of hypoxia's effects on auditory sensitivity have provided mixed results but the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that sensitivity is unaffected by hypoxia. This conclusion is discrepant with that drawn from physiological studies in which hypoxia has been found to affect auditory-evoked response (AER) latency. One possible explanation of this discrepancy concerns the relatively low maximum frequency (8 kHz) for which hypoxia's effects were assessed in the psychophysical studies. We have extended the range of frequencies over which hypoxia's effects have been examined to include frequencies up to 16 kHz. Thresholds for 1-, 8-, 10-, 12-, 14- and 16-kHz tones were measured at levels of hypoxia equivalent to altitudes of 0, 1200, 2400 and 3700 m. Our results indicate that sensitivity for frequencies up to 16 kHz is unaffected by hypoxia. We suggest that AER latency does not provide a valid measure of auditory sensitivity.

AB It is well known that cobalt chloride (CoCl2) can enhance the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha. The aim of this study is to detect the effect of CoCl2 on the hypoxia tolerance of mice which were repeatedly exposed to autoprogressive hypoxia. Balb/c mice were randomly divided into groups of chemical pretreatment and normal saline (NS), respectively injected with CoCl2 and NS 3 h before exposure to hypoxia for 0 run (H0), 1 run (H1), and 4 runs (H4). Western Blot, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), extracellular recordings population spikes in area cornus ammonis I (CA 1) of mouse hippocampal slices and real-time were used in this study. Our results demonstrated that the tolerance of mice to hypoxia, the changes of HIF-1 alpha protein level and HIF-1 DNA binding activity in mice hippocampus, the mRNA level of erythropoietin (EPO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the disappearance time of population spikes of hippocampal slices were substantially different between the control group and the CoCl2 group. Over-induction of HIF-1 alpha by pretreatment with CoCl2 before hypoxia did not increase the hypoxia tolerance.

AB Cells experiencing lowered O-2 levels (hypoxia) undergo a variety of biological responses in order to adapt to these unfavorable conditions. The master switch, orchestrating the cellular response to low O-2 levels, is the transcription factor, termed hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). The alpha subunits of HIF are regulated by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases that. in the presence of O-2, hydroxylate specific prolyl and asparaginyl residues of HIF-alpha. inducing its proteasome-dependent degradation and repression of transcriptional activity, respectively. Hypoxia inhibits oxygenases, stabilized HIF-alpha translocates to the nucleus, dimerizes with HIF-beta, recruits the coactivators p300/CBP, and induces expression of its transcriptional targets via binding to hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs). HREs are composite regulatory elements, comprising a conserved HIF-binding sequence and a highly variable flanking sequence that modulates the transcriptional response. In summary, the transcriptional response of a cell is the end product of two major functions. The first (trans-acting) is the level of activation of the HIF pathway that depends on regulation of stability and transcriptional activity of the HIF-alpha. The second (cis-acting) comprises the characteristics of endogenous HREs that are determined by the availability of transcription factors cooperating with HIF and/or individual HIF-alpha isoforms.

AB Hypoxia induces proliferation and invasion in cancer cells via hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha. The cell adhesion molecule cluster of differentiation (CD)44 has been associated with increased cell invasion and metastasis. Whether hypoxia regulates the expression of CD44 in gastric cancer cells remains to be established. In the current study, the effects of hypoxia on HIF-1 alpha and CD44 expression levels in human gastric cell lines SGC-7901 and BGC-823 were evaluated. The cells were cultured in 1% O-2, for 1 week and then treated with 20 nM rapamycin for 72 h. Cell viability was evaluated using the Cell Counting kit-8 assay, and cell invasion was detected by the Transwell invasion assay. The protein and messenger (m) RNA expression levels of HIF-1 alpha and CD44 were detected using western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The results revealed that cell viability and invasion increased under hypoxic conditions, but decreased following rapamycin treatment in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells. Hypoxia also increased the protein and mRNA expression levels of HIF-1 alpha and CD44 in these two cell lines. However, this hypoxia-induced increase in HIF-1 alpha and CD44 protein and mRNA expression levels was inhibited by rapamycin. These findings suggest that hypoxia induced the proliferation and invasion of SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cells. Furthermore, CD44 expression levels were potentially associated with HIF-1 alpha a expression levels. Therefore, in gastric cancer cells, hypoxia may regulate CD44 expression via HIF-1 alpha a in order to promote cell proliferation and invasion.

   Exposure in a Hawk Simulator
SO AEROSPACE MEDICINE AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE
LA English

DE hypoxia training; normobaric; flight performance; SpO(2)
AB INTRODUCTION: The incidence of hypoxia-like symptoms in military aviators is on the rise. Cases can be related to On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS) malfunction, air contamination, loss of cabin pressurization, hyperventilation, or a combination of these issues simultaneously. Normobaric hypoxia training in tactical fighter simulations has been conducted in the Finnish Air Force since 2008. This training helps aviators to recognize their individual hypoxia symptoms and refreshes hypoxia emergency procedures in a realistic cockpit.
   METHODS: A flight mission included three set-ups and a return to base (RTB) after the third set-up. In a tactical Hawk simulator, different concentrations of oxygen were used (8%, 7%, and 6% oxygen in nitrogen) to create normobaric hypoxia exposures. During the RTB, the flight instructor evaluated the subjects'flight performance (N = 16) in order to estimate cognitive functions after hypoxia. A control flight was evaluated before or after the flight with normobaric hypoxia exposure.
   RESULTS: Instrumental flight rule performance during RTB decreased significantly from 4.81 to 3.63 after normobaric hypoxia and emergency procedures. Some pilots reported fatigue, headache, memory problems, and cognitive impairment as adverse effects up to 12 h after normobaric hypoxia training.
   DISCUSSION: Hypoxia has a significant effect on flight performance during RTB, even 10 min after hypoxia emergency procedures. Since 100% oxygen was used as emergency oxygen, as in a real aircraft, the oxygen paradox may decrease flight performance. Hypoxia training in tactical fighter simulations provides an opportunity for pilots to also understand the effects of the "hypoxia hangover" on their flight performance.

AB We have developed a novel nitroimidazole indocyanine dye conjugate for tumor-targeted hypoxia fluorescence tomography. The hypoxia probe has been evaluated in vitro using tumor cell lines and in vivo with tumor targeting in mice. The in vitro cell studies were performed to assess fluorescence labeling differences between hypoxia and normoxia conditions. When treated with the hypoxia probe, a fluorescence emission ratio of 2.5-fold was found between the cells incubated under hypoxia compared to the cells in normoxia condition. Hypoxia specificity was also confirmed by comparing the cells treated with indocyanine dye alone. In vivo tumor targeting in mice showed that the fluorescence signals measured at the tumor site were twice those at the normal site after 150 min post-injection of the hypoxia probe. On the other hand, the fluorescence signals measured after injection of indocyanine dye were the same at tumor and normal sites. In vivo fluorescence tomography images of mice injected with the hypoxia probe showed that the probe remained for more than 5 to 7 h in the tumors, however, the images of mice injected with indocyanine only dye confirmed that the unbound dye washed out in less than 3 h. These findings are supported with fluorescence images of histological sections of tumor samples using a Li-COR scanner and immunohistochemistry technique for tumor hypoxia.

AB Chronic hypoxia (CH) is believed to induce myocardial protection, but this is in contrast with clinical evidence. Here, we test the hypothesis that repeated brief reoxygenation episodes during prolonged CH improve myocardial tolerance to hypoxia-induced dysfunction. Male 5-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 7-9/group) were exposed for 2 weeks to CH (F1O2 = 0.10), intermittent hypoxia (IH, same as CH, but 1 hr/day exposure to room air), or normoxia (N, F1O2 = 0.21). Hearts were isolated, Langendorff perfused for 30 min with hypoxic medium (Krebs-Henseleit, PO2 = 67 mmHg), and exposed to hyperoxia (PO2 = 670 mmHg). CH hearts displayed higher end-diastolic pressure, lower rate-pressure product, and higher vascular resistance than IH. During hypoxic perfusion, anaerobic mechanisms recruitment was similar in CH and IH hearts, but less than in N. Thus, despite differing only for 1 hr daily exposure to room air, CH and IH induced different responses in animal homeostasis, markers of oxidative stress, and myocardial tolerance to reoxygenation. We conclude that the protection in animals exposed to CH appears conferred by the hypoxic preconditioning due to the reoxygenation rather than by hypoxia per se.

AB Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors that is closely associated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy resistance, metastasis and tumors prognosis. Thus, it is important to assess hypoxia in tumors for estimating prognosis and selecting appropriate treatment procedures. F-18-Fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography (F-18-FMISO PET) has been widely used to visualize tumor hypoxia in a comprehensive and noninvasive way, both in the clinical and preclinical settings. Here we review the concept, mechanisms and detection methods of tumor hypoxia. Furthermore, we discuss the correlation between F-18-FMISO PET and other detection methods, current applications of F-18-FMISO PET and the development prospects of this imaging technology.

AB Hypoxia has been identified as a contributing factor in the pathophysiology of several diseases and oxygen regulation is important during stem cell development, particularly in early embryogenesis. One aspect that has emerged is the role of hypoxia-inducible factors, or HIFs in regulating the effect of hypoxia. Studies in our laboratory sought to examine the hypoxic regulation of HIF activity in placental trophoblast cells, through the use of dual-reporter luciferase assays. Our study demonstrates that hypoxic conditions cause a significant increase in the level of constitutive luciferase reporter activity. We also show that this induction is not a cell type or species-specific phenomenon and provides an alternative method for normalizing transfection efficiency in luciferase assays under hypoxic conditions. Our results suggest that in studies dealing with hypoxic conditions, caution should be used when interpreting measurements of transcriptional activity by traditional dual-reporter assays.

DE hypoxia signature; aviationtraining; subjective symptoms; acute hypoxia.
   Deliveredby Ingenta
AB INTRODUCTION: Exposure to high ambient altitudes above 10,000 ft (3048 m) over sea level during aviation can present the risk of hypobaric hypoxia. Hypoxia can impair sensory and cognitive functions, degrading performance and leading to mishaps. Military aircrew undergo regular hypoxia familiarization training to recognize their symptoms and understand the consequences of hypoxia. However, over the years, aviators have come to believe that individuals have a "personal hypoxia signature." The idea is that intraindividual variability in symptom experience during repeated exposure is low. In other words, individuals will experience the same symptoms during hypoxia from day to day, year to year. METHODS: We critically reviewed the existing literature on this hypothesis. Most studies that claim to support the notion of a signature only examine group-level data, which do not inform individual-level consistency. Other studies use inappropriate statistical methods, while still others do not control for accuracy of recall over the period of years. To combat these shortcomings, we present a dataset of 91 individuals who completed nearly identical mask -off, normobaric hypoxia exposures days apart. RESULTS: We found that for every symptom on the Hypoxia Symptom Questionnaire, at least half of the subjects reported the symptom inconsistently across repeated exposure. This means that, at best, 50% of subjects did not report the same symptom across exposures. DISCUSSION: These data provide compelling evidence against the existence of hypoxia signatures. We urge that hypoxia familiarization training incorporate these findings and encourage individuals to expect a wide range of hypoxia symptoms upon repeated exposure

AB It is not known whether changes in antioxidant levels always occur in fish in response to the oxidative stress that usually accompanies a hypoxic challenge. The studies of antioxidant responses to hypoxia in fish have mostly focused on very anoxia-tolerant species and indicate that there is an enhancement of antioxidant defenses. Here we present new data on redox-active antioxidants from three species, which range in their tolerance to hypoxia: the epaulette shark, threespine stickleback, and rainbow trout, together with a compilation of results from other studies that have measured oxidative stress parameters in hypoxia-exposed fish. The results suggest that in general, fish do not show an increase in redox-active antioxidant defense in response to oxidative stress associated with hypoxia. Rather, the changes in antioxidant defenses during hypoxia are very much species- and tissue-specific and are not linked to the level of hypoxia tolerance of the fish species.

AB The anoxemia theory proposes that an imbalance between the demand for and supply of oxygen in the arterial wall is a key factor in the development of atherosclerosis. There is now substantial evidence that there are regions within the atherosclerotic plaque in which profound hypoxia exists; this may fundamentally change the function, metabolism, and responses of many of the cell types found within the developing plaque and whether the plaque will evolve into a stable or unstable phenotype. Hypoxia is characterized in molecular terms by the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1, a subunit of the heterodimeric nuclear transcriptional factor HIF-1 and a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis. The expression of HIF-1 is localized to perivascular tissues, inflammatory macrophages, and smooth muscle cells adjacent to the necrotic core of atherosclerotic lesions and regulates several genes that are important to vascular function including vascular endothelial growth factor, nitric oxide synthase, endothelin-1, and erythropoietin. This review summarizes the effects of hypoxia on the functions of cells involved in atherogenesis and the evidence for its potential importance from experimental models and clinical studies.

AB We Studied the in vivo persistence of hypoxia-inducible factor-l alpha (HIF-l alpha), main transducer of hypoxia, the differential response in organs exposed to the same degree of hypoxemia and the relationship with apoptosis. We measured HIF-l alpha (immunohistochemistry peroxidase and Western blot) and apoptosis (TUNEL) in heart, liver, kidney, gastrocnemius, and brain of rats exposed to chronic normobaric hypoxia (10% O-2) or normoxia (21% O-2) for 2 weeks. Despite same arterial O-2 pressure and increased hemoglobin concentration (219 +/- 5 vs. 124 +/- 4 g/L), the organs responded differently. While marked in brain, muscle, and kidney cortex, HIF-1 alpha Was undetectable in heart and liver. In kidney medulla, HIF-l alpha was high in both normoxia and hypoxia. By contrast, apoptosis was marked in heart, slight in kidney medulla, and undetectable in other organs. We conclude that the HIF-l alpha response to chronic hypoxia can be a Sustained phenomenon, but not in all organs, and that apoptosis responds differently from HIF-l alpha. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

   IMPACT
AB Hypoxia is a characteristic of tumors, is known to increase aggressiveness, and causes treatment re-sistance. Traditional classification suggests two types of hypoxia: chronic and acute. Acute hypoxia is mostly caused by transient disruptions in perfusion, while chronic hypoxia is caused by diffusion limitations. This classification may be insufficient in terms of pathogenetic and pathophysiological mechanisms. Therefore, we quantified hypoxia subtypes in tumors based on (immuno-)fluorescent marker distribution patterns in microcirculatory supply units (MCSUs).
   Cryosections from hSCC lines (SAS, FaDu, UT-SCC-5, UT-SCC-14, UT-SCC-15) were analyzed. Hypoxia was identified by pimonidazole, perfusion by Hoechst 33342, and endothelial cells by CD31. The following patterns were identified in vital tumor tissue: (1) normoxia: Hoechst 33342 fluorescence around microvessels, no pimonidazole, (2) chronic hypoxia: Hoechst 33342 fluorescence around microvessels, pimonidazole distant from microvessels, (3) acute hypoxia: no Hoechst 33342 fluorescence around microvessels, pimonidazole in immediate vicinity of microvessels, and (4) hypoxemic hypoxia: Hoechst 33342 fluorescence and pimonidazole directly around microvessels.
   Quantitative assessment of MCSUs show predominance for normoxia in 4 out of 5 tumor lines (50.1-72.8%). Total hypoxia slightly prevails in UT-SCC-15 (56.9%). Chronic hypoxia is the dominant subtype (65.4-85.9% of total hypoxia). Acute hypoxia only accounts for 12.9-29.8% and hypoxemic hypoxia for 1.2-6.4% of total hypoxia. The fraction of perfused microvessels ranged from 82.5-96.6%.
   Chronic hypoxia is the prevailing subtype in MCSUs. Acute hypoxia and hypoxemic hypoxia account for only a small fraction. This approach enables assessment and recognition of different hypoxia subtypes including hypoxemic hypoxia and may facilitate methods to (clinically) identify and eliminate hypoxia.

AB WOODROW AD, WEBB JT, WIER GS. Recollection of hypoxia symptons between training events. Aviat Space Environ Med 2011; 82:1143-7.
   Introduction: The well-established technique of mask-off hypoxia training in a hypobaric training environment elicits symptoms that are correlated with in-flight symptoms reported by aircrew. Aircrew receive training on recognition of symptoms and response early in their flying career and accomplish refresher training on a 5-yr cycle. The symptoms reported after acute hypoxia represent cognitive and psychomotor impairment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation of symptoms experienced during hypoxia training and recall of symptoms from the training sessions 5 yr previously. Methods: A survey listing 18 symptoms of hypoxia and severity of condition was presented to 1123 aircrew attending refresher training at 10 U.S. Air Force Aerospace Physiology Training Units prior to and immediately following hypoxia training in the hypobaric chamber. Results: The five symptoms most commonly reported following hypoxia training are: lightheaded/dizzy, dizziness, mental confusion, visual impairment, and tingling. The hypoxia symptom "lightheaded/dizzy" recorded the highest frequency of all 18 symptoms. Lightheaded/dizzy frequencies for both previous and current hypoxia training were 67.2% and 72.3%, respectively. This symptom remained consistent throughout all data analysis, retaining the highest frequency in all levels of severity (mild, moderate, and extreme) for both the previous hypoxia training and current hypoxia training. Discussion: The similarity of symptoms recalled between hypoxia training events provides strong evidence that hypoxia training is an effective method of establishing recognized decrements that may influence performance in flight.

AB The history of radiotherapy is intertwined with research on hypoxia. There is level 1a evidence that giving hypoxia-targeting treatments with radiotherapy improves locoregional control and survival without compromising late side-effects. Despite coming in and out of vogue over decades, there is now an established role for hypoxia in driving molecular alterations promoting tumour progression and metastases. While tumour genomic complexity and immune profiling offer promise, there is a stronger evidence base for personalising radiotherapy based on hypoxia status. Despite this, there is only one phase III trial targeting hypoxia modification with full transcriptomic data available. There are no biomarkers in routine use for patients undergoing radiotherapy to aid management decisions, and a roadmap is needed to ensure consistency and provide a benchmark for progression to application. Gene expression signatures address past limitations of hypoxia biomarkers and could progress biologically optimised radiotherapy. Here, we review recent developments in generating hypoxia gene expression signatures and highlight progress addressing the challenges that must be overcome to pave the way for their clinical application.

The effect of hypoxia preconditioning on DNA methyltransferase and PP1 in hippocampus of hypoxia preconditioned mice. High Alt Med Biol 15:483-490, 2014.It is well known that hypoxia preconditioning can increase hypoxic tolerance by changing the expressions of some genes in the brain. DNA methylation is important for regulating gene expression and is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), an enzyme that is abundant in the brain. However, the impact of hypoxia preconditioning on DNA methylation remains unknown. In the current study, mice were randomly divided into three groups: blank control group with no exposure to hypoxia (H0), the hypoxia control group exposed to hypoxia once (H1), and the hypoxia preconditioning group exposed to 4 runs of hypoxia (H4). The mRNA and protein levels of three kinds of DNMTs and the activity of total DMNT were measured. Protein phosphatase 1(PP1), which critically regulates neuroprotective pathways in brain, was measured in mRNA and protein activity and promoter methylation. DNMT1 was unchanged in H1 and H4, while DNMT3A and DNMT3B were decreased in H4. The mRNA and protein levels of PP1 were decreased in H4. However, there was no detectable change in the level of DNA methylation of the promoter of PP1 (-321bp to 95bp). These findings suggest that DNA methylation may have a role in hypoxia neuroprotection, and the change of PP1, which did not depend on the change of its promoter (-321bp to 95bp) DNA methylation, may be involved in neuroprotection.

AB Low oxygen pressure (hypoxia) is a physiological condition that has been linked to tumor progression and increased malignancy in several cancer forms. Cells of the childhood neoplasm neuroblastoma respond to hypoxia by attaining a lower grade of differentiation, which clinically is associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, expression of the hypoxia inducible factor-2 alpha correlates to poor outcome in neuroblastoma patients. In this report we have by microarray analysis studied transcriptional changes in seven neuroblastoma cell lines subjected to long term hypoxia. We find the gene regulatory response to be highly dependent on cell line background, however, a set of genes was coherently regulated by hypoxia and these genes are correlated to known hypoxia-induced transcriptional profiles.

AB Vascular disruption secondary to fracture creates a hypoxic gradient of injury wherein the oxygen tension at the center of the wound is very low, In vivo this hypoxic microenvironment stimulates the expression of a variety of cytokines from inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and osteoblasts. In order to begin to dissect this complex system, we have examined the effects of hypoxia on isolated osteoblast gene expression in vitro. Understanding gene expression in this system may facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic modalities designed to accelerate fracture repair and reduce complications. Using an established model of in vitro hypoxia, we have analyzed the expression of genes involved in bone matrix production and turnover. Subconfluent neonatal rat calvarial osteoblasts were exposed to hypoxia (pO(2) = 35-40 mm Hg) and total cellular RNA was collected at 0, 3, 6, 24, and 48 h, Northern analysis was used to analyze the expression patterns of (1) transforming growth factors (TGFs)-beta1, -beta2, and -beta3 and their type I receptor; (2) collagens I and III; and (3) tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-l. We have demonstrated a marked elevation of TGF-beta1 gene expression within 3 h of hypoxia. Although neither TGF-beta2 nor TGF-beta3 expression was affected by hypoxia, the TGF-beta type I receptor was substantially upregulated within 6 h, In addition, extracellular matrix scaffolding molecules (collagens I and III) were markedly, but differentially, upregulated. Finally, we have demonstrated that the expression of an inhibitor of extracellular matrix turnover, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, was strikingly decreased in response to hypoxia. These results imply that hypoxia can affect osseous healing by altering the expression of cytokines, bone-specific extracellular matrix molecules, and their regulators. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB Hypoxia pathway and aberrant miRNA expression profile play crucial roles in the development of various cancers. Recent studies have emphasized that there are many collaborations in this cases because both of them are involved in cancer cell processes, including differentiation, metastasis, and cell proliferation and signaling pathways. Further studies have elucidated that miRNAs affect the hypoxia route, and more interesting-ly, the hypoxia pathway also affects miRNAs expression profile. The literature review summarizes the funda-mental roles of hypoxia-related miRNAs in different cancers. The mutual interactions between miRNAs and hy-poxia are a new layer of complexity in cancer hypoxia, which might be helpful in controlling cancer progres-sion. It is also possible that the hypoxia pathway is initiated by miRNAs. In contrast, the hypoxia pathway regu-lates the expression of a large group of miRNAs. In this review for the first time, we discussed the significant interactions between hypoxia and miRNAs in order to determine new perspectives for new therapeutic aims in the field of cancer.

AB Higher animals depend on an adequate oxygen flux. Mechanisms involved in the process of sensing and responding to hypoxia have become clearer in the last 15 years with the discovery of the alpha y beta hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) subunits and hydroxylases involved in their regulation. Reactive oxygen species seem to play some role in the process of sensing and responding to hypoxia.
   Skeletal muscle cells seem to be a suitable model for studying the hypoxia-reactive oxygen species-HIF-cellular response relationship. Its study has important basic and clinic implications. However, the study of this relationship just begins. Some interesting aspects regarding skeletal muscle research are reviewed in this article, and some questions and hypotheses suitable for being evaluated with muscle cells are discussed.

AB Many fish encounter hypoxia on a daily cycle, but the physiological effects of intermittent hypoxia are poorly understood. We investigated whether acclimation to constant (sustained) hypoxia or to intermittent diel cycles of nocturnal hypoxia (12 h normoxia: 12 h hypoxia) had distinct effects on hypoxia tolerance or on several determinants of O-2 transport and O-2 utilization in estuarine killifish. Adult killifish were acclimated to normoxia, constant hypoxia, or intermittent hypoxia for 7 or 28 days in brackish water (4 ppt). Acclimation to both hypoxia patterns led to comparable reductions in critical O-2 tension and resting O-2 consumption rate, but only constant hypoxia reduced the O-2 tension at loss of equilibrium. Constant (but not intermittent) hypoxia decreased filament length and the proportion of seawater-type mitochondrion-rich cells in the gills (which may reduce ion loss and the associated costs of active ion uptake), increased blood haemoglobin content, and reduced the abundance of oxidative fibres in the swimming muscle. In contrast, only intermittent hypoxia augmented the oxidative and gluconeogenic enzyme activities in the liver and increased the capillarity of glycolytic muscle, each of which should facilitate recovery between hypoxia bouts. Neither exposure pattern affected muscle myoglobin content or the activities of metabolic enzymes in the brain or heart, but intermittent hypoxia increased brain mass. We conclude that the pattern of hypoxia exposure has an important influence on the mechanisms of acclimation, and that the optimal strategies used to cope with intermittent hypoxia may be distinct from those for coping with constant hypoxia.

AB In recent years, natural and anthropogenic factors have increased aquatic hypoxia the world over. In most organisms, the cellular response to hypoxia is mediated by the master regulator hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 also plays a critical role in the normal development of the cardiovascular system of vertebrates. We tested the hypothesis that hypoxia exposures which resulted in HIF-1 induction during embryogenesis would be associated with enhanced hypoxia tolerance in subsequent developmental stages. We exposed zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to just 4 h of severe hypoxia or total anoxia at 18, 24 and 36 h post-fertilization (hpf). Of these, exposure to hypoxia at 24 and 36 hpf as well as anoxia at 36 hpf activated the HIF-1 cellular pathway. Zebrafish embryos that acutely upregulated the HIF-1 pathway had an increased hypoxia tolerance as larvae. The critical window for hypoxia sensitivity and HIF-1 signalling was 24 hpf. Adult male fish had a lower critical oxygen tension (P-crit) compared with females. Early induction of HIF-1 correlated directly with an increased proportion of males in the population. We conclude that mounting a HIF-1 response during embryogenesis is associated with long-term impacts on the phenotype of later stages which could influence both individual hypoxia tolerance and population dynamics.

AB Mounting evidence has revealed a causative role of intermittent hypoxia (IH) in cancer progression in mouse models of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but most studies have focused on the effects of IH following tumor implantation using an exposure to single IH frequency. Thus, we aimed to investigate 1) the potential effect of IH on the initial tumor growth in patients with OSA without an interaction with other mechanisms induced by IH in mice and 2) the influence of the IH frequency on tumor growth, which were tested using pre-conditioning with IH (Pre-IH) and 2 different IH frequencies, respectively. Pre-IH was achieved by alternatively maintaining melanoma cells between normoxia (10 min, 21% O-2) and hypoxia (50 min, 1% O-2) for 7 days (12 cycles per day) before administering them to mice. The conditions for IH-1 and IH-2 were 90 s of 12% FiO(2) followed by 270s of 21% FiO(2) (10 cycles/h), and 90 s of 12% FiO(2) and 90 s of 21% FiO(2) (20 cycles/h), respectively, for 8 h per day. Tumor growth was significantly higher in the Pre-IH group than in the normoxia group. In addition, the IH-2 group showed more accelerated tumor growth compared to the normoxia and IH-1 groups. Immunohistochemistry and gene-expression results consistently showed the up-regulation of molecules associated with HIF-1 alpha-dependent hypoxic adaptation in tumors of the Pre-IH and IH-2 groups. Our findings reveal that IH increased tumor progression in a frequency-dependent manner, regardless of whether it was introduced before or after in vivo tumor cell implantation.

AB Tissue hypoxia has been proposed as an important factor in the pathophysiology of both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI), initiating and propagating a vicious cycle of tubular injury, vascular rarefaction, and fibrosis and thus exacerbation of hypoxia. Here, we critically evaluate this proposition by systematically reviewing the literature relevant to the following six questions: (i) Is kidney disease always associated with tissue hypoxia? (ii) Does tissue hypoxia drive signalling cascades that lead to tissue damage and dysfunction? (iii) Does tissue hypoxia per se lead to kidney disease? (iv) Does tissue hypoxia precede pathology? (v) Does tissue hypoxia colocalize with pathology? (vi) Does prevention of tissue hypoxia prevent kidney disease? We conclude that tissue hypoxia is a common feature of both AKI and CKD. Furthermore, at least under in vitro conditions, renal tissue hypoxia drives signalling cascades that lead to tissue damage and dysfunction. Tissue hypoxia itself can lead to renal pathology, independent of other known risk factors for kidney disease. There is also some evidence that tissue hypoxia precedes renal pathology, at least in some forms of kidney disease. However, we have made relatively little progress in determining the spatial relationships between tissue hypoxia and pathological processes (i.e. colocalization) or whether therapies targeted to reduce tissue hypoxia can prevent or delay the progression of renal disease. Thus, the hypothesis that tissue hypoxia is a common pathway to both AKI and CKD still remains to be adequately tested.

AB Thioredoxin-Interacting Protein (Txnip) is an important regulator of glucose metabolism and functions by inhibiting cellular glucose uptake. The expression of the Txnip gene is sensitive to glucose availability and is negatively correlated with the glycolytic rate. Here we show that hypoxia induces a rapid decrease in Txnip mRNA and protein expression in a Hypoxia-Inducible Factor independent manner. Hypoxia caused reduced binding of the glucose responsive MondoA:Mlx transcription factor to the carbohydrate response elements (ChoREs) in the Txnip promoter. Our data suggest that hypoxia decreases MondoA: Mlx activity by increasing glycolytic flux, leading to the depletion of glycolytic intermediates which normally activate MondoA: Mlx. Hypoxia dependent Txnip down-regulation may be an important compensatory mechanism through which cancer cells adapt their metabolism to low oxygen concentrations.

AB The treatment and prevention of hypoxic/ischemic brain injury in stroke patients remain a severe and global medical issue. Numerous clinical studies have resulted in a failure to develop chemical neuroprotection for acute, ischemic stroke. Over 150 estimated clinical trials of ischemic stroke treatments have been done, and more than 200 drugs and combinations of drugs for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes have been developed. Billions of dollars have been invested for new scientific breakthroughs with only limited success. The revascularization of occluded cerebral arteries such as anti-clot treatments of thrombolysis has proven effective, but it can only be used in a 3-4.5 h time frame after the onset of a stroke, and not for every patient. This review is about novel insights on how to resist tissue hypoxia from unconventional animal models. Ability to resist tissue hypoxia is an extraordinary ability that is not common in many laboratory animals such as rat and mouse models. For example, we can learn from a naked mole-rat, Chrysemys picta, how to actively regulate brain metabolic activity to defend the brain against fluctuating oxygen tension and acute bouts of oxidative stress following the onset of a stroke. Additionally, a euthermic arctic ground squirrel can teach us how the brain of a stroke patient can remain well oxygenated during tissue hypoxia with no evidence of cellular stress. In this review, we discuss how these animals provide us with a system to gain insight into the possible mechanisms of tissue hypoxia/ischemia. This issue is of clinical significance to stroke patients. We describe specific physiological and molecular adaptations employed by different animals' models of hypoxia tolerance in aquatic and terrestrial environments. We highlight how these adaptations might provide potential clues on strategies to adapt for the clinical management of tissue hypoxia during conditions such as stroke where oxygen demand fails to match the supply.

AB Background: Aging is associated with cellular and tissue responses that collectively lead to functional and structural deterioration of tissues. Poor tissue oxygenation, or hypoxia, is involved in such responses and contributes to aging. Consequently, it could be speculated that living at higher altitude, and therefore in hypoxic conditions, accelerates aging. This assumption is indeed supported by evidence from populations residing at very high altitudes (>3,500 m). In contrast, accumulating evidence suggests that living at moderate altitudes (1,500-2,500 m) is protective rather than injurious, at least for some body systems. Summary: In this review, we critically evaluate the hypothesis that the physiological responses to mild hypoxic stress associated to life at moderate altitudes provide protection from many hypoxia-related diseases through hormesis. Hormesis means that a low dose of a stressor (here hypoxia) elicits beneficial outcomes, while a higher dose can be toxic and might explain at least in part the dose-dependent contrasting effects of hypoxia on the aging processes. The lack of well-designed longitudinal studies focusing on the role of the altitude of residence, and difficulties in accounting for potentially confounding factors such as migration, ethnicity/genetics, and socioeconomic and geoclimatic conditions, currently hampers translation of related research into uncontroversial paradigms. Key Messages: Deeper investigations are required to understand the impact of altitude-related hypoxia on age-related diseases and to develop molecular markers of ageing/senescence in humans that are linked to hypoxia. However, the presented emerging evidence supports the view that hypoxia conditioning has the potential to improve life quality and expectancy.

AB BACKGROUNDInsect tolerance to low oxygen (hypoxia) and high carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) is critical for insect control. On the basis of bioassay, metabolism profiles were built to investigate adaptive mechanisms in bean weevil under hypoxia (2% O-2), hypoxia/hypercapnia (2% O-2 + 18% CO2) and normoxia (control, 20% O-2 + 80% N-2) using gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS).
   RESULTSThe growth and development of bean weevils were significantly suppressed by the two hypoxia conditions; hypercapnia enhanced the mortality, but after 24 days of exposure, the surviving insects emerged as adults earlier than those under hypoxia only. Metabolism profiles also showed striking differences in metabolites among the treatment and control groups, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Pairwise comparisons of the three groups showed that 61 metabolites changed significantly, 40 in the hypoxia group and 37 in the hypoxia/hypercapnia group relative to the control group, while only 16 were shared equally by the hypoxia and hypoxia/hypercapnia groups. Increased metabolites were mainly carbohydrates, amino acids and organic acids, while free fatty acids were decreased. Furthermore, the changes were strengthened by the addition of hypercapnia, but excluding free fatty acids.
   CONCLUSIONThe findings show that bean weevil has high tolerance to hypoxia or even hypoxia/hypercapnia at biologically achievable levels and provide more direct evidence for stored product insect mechanism regulation under hypoxia stress, especially free fatty acid regulation by hypercapnia but not by hypoxia.

AB The androgen receptor (AR) acts as a ligand-dependent transcriptional factor controlling development or progression of prostate cancer. Androgen ablation by castration is an effective therapy for prostate cancer, whereas eventually most of the tumors convert from a hormone-sensitive to a hormone-refractory disease state and grow even in a low androgen environment (e.g., 0.1 nM 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)) like the castration-resistant stage. Androgen ablation results in hypoxia, and solid tumors possess hypoxic environments. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, which is composed of HIF-1 alpha and HIF-1 beta/ARNT sub-units, functions as a master transcription factor for hypoxia-inducible genes. Here, we report that hypoxia enhances AR transactivation in the presence of 0.05 and 0.1 nM DHT in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-1 alpha inhibited hypoxia-enhanced AR transactivation. Its inhibition by HIF-1 alpha siRNA was canceled by expression of a siRNA-resistant form of HIF-1 alpha. HIF-1 alpha siRNA repressed hypoxia-stimulated expression of the androgen-responsive NKX3.1 gene in the presence of 0.1 nM DHT, but not in the absence of DHT. In hypoxia, HIF-1 alpha siRNA-repressed AR transactivation was restored in mutants in which HIF-1 alpha lacked DNA-binding activity. Furthermore, a dominant negative form of HIF-1 alpha canceled hypoxia-enhanced AR transactivation, and HIF-1 beta/ARNT siRNAs had no influence on hypoxia-enhanced AR transactivation. These results indicate that hypoxia leads to HIF-1 alpha-mediated AR transactivation independent of HIF-1 activity and that HIF-1 beta/ARNT is not necessarily required for the transactivation.

AB Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) are designed to specifically target the hypoxic cells of tumors, which are an important cause of treatment resistance to conventional therapies. Despite promising preclinical and clinical phase I and II results, the most important of which are described in this review, the implementation of hypoxia-activated prodrugs in the clinic has, so far, not been successful. The lack of stratification of patients based on tumor hypoxia status, which can vary widely, is sufficient to account for the failure of phase III trials. To fully exploit the potential of hypoxia-activated prodrugs, hypoxia stratification of patients is needed. Here, we propose a biomarker-stratified enriched Phase III study design in which only biomarker-positive (i.e. hypoxia-positive) patients are randomized between standard treatment and the combination of standard treatment with a hypoxia-activated prodrug. This implies the necessity of a Phase II study in which the biomarker or a combination of biomarkers will be evaluated. The total number of patients needed for both clinical studies will be far lower than in currently used randomize-all designs. In addition, we elaborate on the improvements in HAP design that are feasible to increase the treatment success rates. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Overcoming the chemoresistance of bladder cancer is a pivotal obstacle in clinical treatments. Hypoxia widely exists in solid tumors and has been demonstrated to contribute to chemoresistance through hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)-mediated autophagy in several types of cancer. However, it is unclear whether HIF-1-mediated autophagy and chemoresistance occur in bladder cancer. The present study demonstrated that HIF-1 was overexpressed in 20 bladder cancer tissues compared with matched paracarcinoma tissues. Gemcitabine-induced apoptosis during hypoxia was significantly reduced compared with that observed under normoxic conditions. In addition, hypoxia activated autophagy and enhanced gemcitabine-induced autophagy. Combined treatment using gemcitabine and an autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine) under hypoxia significantly increased gemcitabine cytotoxicity. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that hypoxia-activated autophagy depended on the HIF-1/BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3)/Beclin1 signaling pathway. Suppressing HIF-1 inhibited autophagy, BNIP3 and Beclin1, as well as enhanced gemcitabine-induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. Consequently, the results of the present study demonstrated that hypoxia-induced cytoprotective autophagy counteracted gemcitabine-induced apoptosis through increasing HIF-1 expression. Therefore, targeting HIF-1-associated pathways or autophagy in bladder cancer may be a successful strategy to enhance the sensitivity of bladder cancer chemotherapy.

AB Purpose High-grade gliomas are aggressive primitive brain tumors presenting aberrant vasculature, regional necrosis, and areas of hypoxia. Tumor hypoxia is associated with resistance to conventional treatment and worse prognosis. [F-18]-fluoromisonidazole (F-18-FMISO) is the most extensively investigated radiotracer for the evaluation of hypoxia. However, the use of F-18-FMISO in clinical practice has been hampered mainly due to the slow clearance of the unbound tracer from normoxic tissue and its low tumor-to-background ratio (TBR). The research community has therefore investigated other radiotracers to overcome the drawbacks of F-18-FMISO. This mini-review aims to present an update on the most relevant PET studies published in the last 15 years evaluating the utility of radiotracers for hypoxia imaging other than F-18-FMISO in high-grade glioma (HGG) patients. Methods A comprehensive computer literature search of studies was carried out in PubMed/MEDLINE database to identify the most relevant studies published in the last 15 years which investigated the utility of hypoxia PET tracers other than F-18-FMISO in the assessment of tumor hypoxia in patients with HGG. Results F-18-flouroazomycin arabinoside (F-18-FAZA) has been proposed as a valid alternative to F-18-FMISO for the assessment of hypoxia, due to its improved biodistribution and enhanced tumor-to-background ratio. Also 1-(2-[F-18]fluoro-1[hydroxymethyl]ethoxy)methyl-2-nitroimidazole(F-18-FRP170) seems a valuable hypoxia tracer in patients with brain tumor. The value of copper-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone)(Cu-ATSM) seems controversial. Few evidences still exist regarding the utility of F-18-2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl)-acetamide (F-18-EF5). Conclusion Hypoxia PET imaging has the potential to provide useful information for the clinicians and to guide hypoxia tailored treatments. According to the present literature, the most promising hypoxic tracer seems to be F-18-FAZA, but well-designed and wide trials to validate hypoxia radiotracers and evaluate their clinical utility in daily practice are still lacking.

AB We report the design and synthesis of an activatable molecular imaging probe to detect hypoxia in mouse models of retinal vascular diseases. Hypoxia of the retina has been associated with the initiation and progression of blinding retinal vascular diseases including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity. In vivo retinal imaging of hypoxia may be useful for early detection and timely treatment of retinal diseases. To achieve this goal, we synthesized HYPOX-3, a near-infrared (NIR) imaging agent coupled to a dark quencher, Black Hole Quencher 3 (BHQ3), which has been previously reported to contain a hypoxia-sensitive cleavable azo-bond. HYPOX-3 was cleaved in hypoxic retinal cell culture and animal models, enabling detection of hypoxia with high signal-to-noise ratios without acute toxicity. HYPOX-3 fluorescences in hypoxic cells and tissues and was undetectable under normoxia. These imaging agents are promising candidates for imaging retinal hypoxia in preclinical disease models and patients.

AB Introduction Tumour hyperglycolysis is driven by activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) through tumour hypoxia. Accordingly, the degree of 2-fluro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake by tumours might indirectly reflect the level of hypoxia, obviating the need for more specific radiopharmaceuticals for hypoxia imaging.
   Discussion In this paper, available data on the relationship between hypoxia and FDG uptake by tumour tissue in vitro and in vivo are reviewed. In pre-clinical in vitro studies, acute hypoxia was consistently shown to increase FDG uptake by normal and tumour cells within a couple of hours after onset with mobilisation or modification of glucose transporters optimising glucose uptake, followed by a delayed response with increased rates of transcription of GLUT mRNA. In pre-clinical imaging studies on chronic hypoxia that compared FDG uptake by tumours grown in rat or mice to uptake by FMISO, the pattern of normoxic and hypoxic regions within the human tumour xenografts, as imaged by FMISO, largely correlated with glucose metabolism although minor locoregional differences could not be excluded. In the clinical setting, data are limited and discordant.
   Conclusion Further evaluation of FDG uptake by various tumour types in relation to intrinsic and bioreductive markers of hypoxia and response to radiotherapy or hypoxia-dependent drugs is needed to fully assess its application as a marker of hypoxia in the clinical setting.

AB Aim: Analysis of radioprotective effect of respiratory hypoxia on hemopoietic tissue and enhancement of this effect by hemopoietic activation.
   Material and Methods: In mice breathing hypoxic gas mixture during total body gamma irradiation the recovery of pluripotent and committed granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells and animal Lethality were determined.
   Results: In mice forced to breathe 10% O-2 and 8% O-2 during irradiation, the oxygen tension in the spleen decreased to 40% and 20%, respectively, of control values. Hypoxia mitigated the Lethal effect of gamma-rays and improved the recovery of hemopoiesis in compartments of pluripotent and committed progenitor cells. Enhancement of the proliferative activity in hemopoietic tissue by a cytokine (rmGM-CSF) or an immunomodulator (dextran sulfate) increased the effect of hypoxic radio protection, white elimination of proliferative cells by hydroxyurea decreased the radioprotective effect. Adaptation of experimental animals to hypoxic conditions was found to reduce the radioprotective effect without influencing tissue partial oxygen pressure Lowered by hypoxic conditions.
   Conclusion: The data presented confirm the radioprotective effect of 10% and 8% O-2 respiratory hypoxia on hemopoiesis. These findings may represent a way out for further experimental and clinical research aimed at considering differential protection of various tissues by hypoxia.

AB This review reports on the effects of hypoxia on human skeletal muscle tissue. It was hypothesized in early reports that chronic hypoxia, as the main physiological stress during exposure to altitude, per se might positively affect muscle oxidative capacity and capillarity. However, it is now established that sustained exposure to severe hypoxia has detrimental effects on muscle structure. Short-term effects on skeletal muscle structure can readily be observed after 2 months of acute exposure of lowlanders to severe hypoxia, e.g. during typical mountaineering expeditions to the Himalayas. The full range of phenotypic malleability of muscle tissue is demonstrated in people living permanently at high altitude (e.g. at La Paz, 3600-4000 m). In addition, there is some evidence for genetic adaptations to hypoxia in high-altitude populations such as Tibetans and Quechuas, who have been exposed to altitudes in excess of 3500 m for thousands of generations. The hallmark of muscle adaptation to hypoxia in all these cases is a decrease in muscle oxidative capacity concomitant with a decrease in aerobic work capacity. It is thought that local tissue hypoxia is an important adaptive stress for muscle tissue in exercise training, so these results seem contra-intuitive. Studies have therefore been conducted in which subjects were exposed to hypoxia only during exercise sessions. In this situation, the potentially negative effects of permanent hypoxic exposure and other confounding variables related to exposure to high altitude could be avoided. Training in hypoxia results, at the molecular level, in an upregulation of the regulatory subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). Possibly as a consequence of this upregulation of HIF-1, the levels mRNAs for myoglobin, for vascular endothelial growth factor and for glycolytic enzymes, such as phosphofructokinase, together with mitochondrial and capillary densities, increased in a hypoxia-dependent manner. Functional analyses revealed positive effects on Col. (when measured at altitude) on maximal power output and on lean body mass. In addition to the positive effects of hypoxia training on athletic performance, there is some recent indication that hypoxia training has a positive effect on the risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

AB Cell injury due to hypoxia and reoxygenation was investigated in the system of parenchymal hepatocytes isolated From fasted rats. The functional and structural integrity of hepatocytes in hypoxia was evaluated on the basis of protein synthesis and [Rb-86] release from prelabelled hepatocytes. Incubation of hepatocytes in nitrogen atmosphere resulted in significant inhibition of incorporation of [C-14]-valine into hepatocyte protein. Treatment of hepatocytes in hypoxia with the antioxidant stobadine (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 muM) reversed protein synthesis almost to control values. No changes were observed in [Rb-86] release from prelabelled hepatocytes. In the experiment with hypoxia/reoxygenation, hepatocytes were exposed to GO min hypoxia followed by 120 min reoxygenation and the injury was evaluated by lactate dehyrogenase (LD) leakage and formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The addition of stobadine at the given concentrations (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 muM) before the onset of hypoxia resulted in dose dependent protection from hypoxia/reoxygenation injury of isolated hepatocytes.

AB Metastasis is the major cause of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)-associated mortality. Hypoxia promotes cancer cell migration and remote metastasis, which occur with hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) stabilization and vimentin upregulation. However, the evolutionary dynamics that link the changes in HIF-1 alpha and vimentin levels under hypoxic conditions are not well understood. In the present study, the effects of intermittent hypoxia (IH), continuous hypoxia (CH) and normoxia on the migration and proliferation of human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells were investigated. The results demonstrated that IH significantly increased the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, and this effect was dependent on the number of cycles of hypoxia-reoxygenation. Unexpectedly, IH significantly inhibited cell proliferation, while CH only caused such an effect if hypoxia extended for >= 3 days. IH and CH induced HIF-1 alpha protein accumulation and vimentin upregulation, with a greater effect observed in IH. Knockdown of HIF-1 alpha with siRNA abolished IH-induced cell migration and vimentin upregulation. In summary, multiple cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation have a more pronounced effect on the promotion of TNBC invasiveness than CH; HIF-1 alpha activation and downstream vimentin upregulation may account for this phenotypic change.

AB Hypoxia is known to play important roles in the development and progression of tumors. We previously demonstrated that S100A4, a critical molecule for metastasis, was upregulated in ovarian cancer cells. Therefore, we examined the mechanisms of the upregulation of S100A4 expression in ovarian carcinoma cells, with particular attention paid to the effects of hypoxia. The expression levels of S100A4 were found to be correlated with the invasiveness of ovarian carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo, and the upregulation of S100A4 expression was associated with hypomethylation of CpG sites in the first intron of S100A4 in ovarian carcinoma cell lines and tissues. The expression of S100A4 was increased under hypoxia and was associated with elevated invasiveness, which was inhibited by S100A4 small interfering RNA (siRNA). In addition, exposure to hypoxia reduced the methylation of hypoxia-response elements (HRE) of the S100A4 gene in a time-dependent fashion, in association with the increased binding of HIF-1a to a methylation-free HRE in ovarian carcinoma cells. These results indicate that hypoxia-induced hypomethylation plays an essential role in S100A4 overexpression and the epigenetic transformation of ovarian carcinoma cells into the metastatic phenotype.

AB Hypoxia induces profound changes in the cellular gene expression profile. The discovery of a major transcription factor family activated by hypoxia, HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor), and the factors that contribute to HIF regulation have greatly enhanced our knowledge of the molecular aspects of the hypoxic response. However, in addition to HIF, other transcription factors and cellular pathways are activated by exposure to reduced oxygen. In the present review, we summarize the current knowledge of how additional hypoxia-responsive transcription factors integrate with HIF and how other cellular pathways Such LIS chromatin remodelling, translation regulation and microRNA induction, contribute to the co-ordinated cellular response observed following hypoxic stress.

AB Introduction: In recent years, a number of studies have demonstrated that hypoxia reoxygenation (HR) induced by ischemia postconditioning (IPC) reduces endothelial barrier dysfunction and inflammation in various models. When HR occurs, the P38 mitogenactivated protein kinase (P38 MAPK) breaks down the endothelial barrier. But no study has clearly clarified the effect of hypoxia postconditioning (HPC) on P38 MAPK in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Therefore, we investigated the function of HPC on P38 MAPK during HR in vitro. Methods: Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were cultured in a hypoxic incubator for 8 h. Then cells were reperfused for 12 h (reoxygenation) or postconditioned by 5 min of reoxygenation and 5 min of re-hypoxia 3 times followed by 11.5 h reoxygenation. SB203580 was used as an inhibitor of P38 MAPK. Cell counting kit-8 assay kits were employed to detect cell activity. The corresponding levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1b were examined via Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay. The endothelial barrier was evaluated using fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran leakage assay. Western blot was used to detect claudin-5, phosphorylation of P38 MAPK (P-P38 MAPK) and P38 MAPK expression. Claudin-5 localization was studied by immunofluorescence. Results: HR induced endothelial barrier hyperpermeability, elevated inflammation levels, and increased the P-P38 MAPK. But HPC reduced cell injury and maintained the integrity of the endothelial barrier while inhibiting P-P38 MAPK and increasing expression of claudin-5. HPC redistributed claudin-5 in a continuous and linear pattern on the cell membrane. Conclusions: HPC protects against HR induced downregulation and redistribution of claudin5 by inhibiting P-P38 MAPK. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB Normal oxygen level is critical for niches that together with other components of the niche play vital role in regulating stem or tumor cells behavior. Hypoxia plays an important role in normal development and disease progression, including the growth of solid tumors. The hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are the key mediators of the cellular response to hypoxia. In this review, we focused on the role of HIFs on bone tumor formation. Further, we also emphasized how hypoxia, stem cells, and its niches regulate the bone tumorigenesis. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Hypoxia induces CXCR4 expression and biological activity in gastric

AB Given the important role of CXCR4 in cancer metastasis, microenvironmental factors that modulate CXCR4 may have an impact on the process of tumor expansion. Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors and a significant microenvironmental factor that drives aggressive behavior. CXCR4 is upregulated in several cancer cells under hypoxic conditions, suggesting a relationship between tumor hypoxia and CXCR4. However, the role of hypoxia in regulating CXCR4 in gastric cancer remains poorly understood. KATO III gastric cancer cells were exposed to hypoxia or normoxia. CXCR4 expression in cells transfected with shRNA specific for HIF-1 alpha was investigated by western blotting and flow cytometry. Wound healing, migration and invasion assays were used to assess cell motility and the chemotactic response to CXCL12, a major CXCR4 ligand. CXCR4 expression at the protein level and in the cell membrane was significantly increased in KATO III cells following exposure to hypoxia. This upregulation of CXCR4 was implicated in increased cell motility and enhanced chemotactic responses (migration and invasion) to CXCL12 treatment in vitro. The increases in CXCR4 expression and metastatic potential in gastric cancer cells exposed to hypoxia were blocked by HIF-1 alpha-specific shRNA. Our results indicate that hypoxia upregulates CXCR4 in gastric cancer cells in a HIF-1 alpha-dependent manner, and that upregulation of CXCR4 plays a role in cancer cell migration and invasion. Thus, disrupting the hypoxia-HIF-1 alpha-CXCR4 axis could be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer.

AB Interest in targeting metabolism has been renewed in recent years as research increases understanding of the altered metabolic profile of tumor cells compared with that of normal cells. Metabolic reprogramming allows cancer cells to survive and proliferate in the hostile tumor microenvironment. These metabolic changes support energy generation, anabolic processes, and the maintenance of redox potential, mechanisms that are all essential for the proliferation and survival of tumor cells. The metabolic switch in a number of key metabolic pathways is mainly regulated by genetic events, rendering cancer cells addicted to certain nutrients, such as glutamine. In addition, hypoxia is induced when highly proliferative tumor cells distance themselves from an oxygen supply. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha is largely responsible for alterations in metabolism that support the survival of hypoxic tumor cells. Metabolic alterations and dependencies of cancer cells may be exploited to improve anticancer therapy. This chapter reviews the main aspects of altered metabolism in cancer cells, emphasizing recent advances in glucose, glutamine, and lipid metabolism.

AB Inadequate oxygen supply is a feature of multiple acute and chronic diseases, and hypoxia biosensors can be deployed in engineered cells to study or treat disease. Although mediators of hypoxia-responsiveness have been characterized, dynamics of this response are less understood, and there is no general approach for tuning biosensor performance to meet application-specific needs. To address these gaps, we investigated the use of genetic circuits to enhance biosensor performance through feedback, ultimately achieving both low background and amplified hypoxia-induced gene expression. To build insight into the mechanisms by which our circuits modulate performance, we developed an explanatory mathematical model. Our analysis suggests a previously unreported dual regulatory mechanism in the natural hypoxia response, providing new insights into regulatory dynamics in chronic hypoxia. This study exemplifies the potential of using synthetic gene circuits to perturb natural systems in a manner that uniquely enables the elucidation of novel facets of natural regulation.

AB Recent studies underscore that chronic hypoxia in the tubulointerstitium is a final common pathway to progression to end-stage renal failure regardless of etiology. We used microarray analysis of rat kidneys made hypoxic by unilateral renal artery stenosis to measure transcriptomic events and clarify pathophysiological mechanisms of renal injury induced by chronic hypoxia. Many genes were upregulated in the kidney by chronic hypoxia, but we focused on metallothionein due to its antioxidative properties. Using tubular epithelial cells transfected with a reporter construct of luciferase, driven by the hypoxia-responsive elements (HRE), we found that addition of metallothionein to the culture media increased luciferase activity. This was associated with upregulation of the target genes of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), such as vascular endothelial growth factor and glucose transporter-1. Stimulation of the HIF-HRE pathway by metallothionein was confirmed by metallothionein overexpression. Hypoxia and exogenous metallothionein increased HIF-1 alpha protein without changes in its mRNA levels, suggesting protein stabilization. Upregulation of the HIF-HRE system by metallothionein was associated with phosphorylation of ERK but not Akt. MEK inhibition and rapamycin decreased metallothionein-induced HIF activity. Our study shows that upregulation of metallothionein expression by hypoxia activates the HIF-HRE system through the ERK/mTOR pathway and may be a novel defense against hypoxia.

AB While oxygen is critical to the continued existence of complex organisms, extreme levels of oxygen within a system, known as hypoxia (low levels of oxygen) and hyperoxia (excessive levels of oxygen), potentially promote stress within a defined biological environment. The consequences of tissue hypoxia, a result of a defective oxygen supply, vary in response to the gravity, extent and environment of the malfunction. Persistent pathological hypoxia is incompatible with normal biological functions, and as a result, multicellular organisms have been compelled to develop both organism-wide and cellular-level hypoxia solutions. Both direct, including oxidative phosphorylation down-regulation and inhibition of fatty-acid desaturation, and indirect processes, including altered hypoxia-sensitive transcription factor expression, facilitate the metabolic modifications that occur in response to hypoxia. Due to the dysfunctional vasculature associated with large areas of some cancers, sections of these tumors continue to develop in hypoxic environments. Crucial to drug development, a robust understanding of the significance of these metabolism changes will facilitate our understanding of cancer cell survival. This review defines our current knowledge base of several of the hypoxia-instigated modifications in cancer cell metabolism and exemplifies the correlation between metabolic change and its support of the hypoxic-adapted malignancy.

Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 303: R700-R709, 2012. First published August 15, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00258.2012.-Inter-mittent hypoxia (IH) is a frequent occurrence in sleep and respiratory disorders. Both human and murine studies show that IH may be implicated in metabolic dysfunction. Although the effects of nocturnal low-frequency intermittent hypoxia (IHL) have not been extensively examined, it would appear that IHL and high-frequency intermittent hypoxia (IHH) may elicit distinct metabolic adaptations. To this effect, C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to IHH (cycles of 90 s 6.4% O-2 and 90 s 21% O-2 during daylight), IHL (8% O-2 during daylight hours), or control (CTL) for 5 wk. At the end of exposures, some of the mice were subjected to a glucose tolerance test (GTT; after intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg glucose/g body wt), and others were subjected to an insulin tolerance test (ITT; 0.25 units Humulin/kg body wt), with plasma leptin and insulin levels being measured in fasting conditions. Skeletal muscles were harvested for GLUT4 and proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1-alpha) expression. Both IHH and IHL displayed reduced body weight increases compared with CTL. CTL mice had higher basal glycemic levels, but GTT kinetics revealed marked differences between IHL and IHH, with IHL manifesting the lowest insulin sensitivity compared with either IHH or CTL, and such findings were further confirmed by ITT. No differences emerged in PGC1-alpha expression across the three experimental groups. However, while cytosolic GLUT4 protein expression remained similar in IHL, IHH, and CTL, significant decreases in GLUT4 membrane fraction occurred in hypoxia and were most pronounced in IHL-exposed mice. Thus IHH and IHL elicit differential glucose homeostatic responses despite similar cumulative hypoxic profiles.

AB The content and composition of rat brain gangliosides in various forms of hypoxia is studied. The content of lipid-bound sialic acid is found to be considerably elevated in the earliest stages of hypoxia combined with hypercapnia and cooling. The content of gangliosides remains elevated over the hypoxia period and returns to control values 48 hours after its discontinuation. Repeated hypoxia results in the same changes in rat brain gangliosides. Hemic sodium nitrite-induced hypoxia also leads to a reliable elevation of these lipids. Hypoxia also causes changes in the content of individual ganglioside fractions: a decreased content of mono- and an increased content of polysialogangliosides.

AB Human oncology has clearly demonstrated the existence of hypoxic tumours and the problematic nature of those tumours. Hypoxia is a significant problem in the treatment of all types of solid tumours and a common reason for treatment failure. Hypoxia is a negative prognostic indicator of survival and is correlated with the development of metastatic disease. Resistance to radiation therapy and chemotherapy can be because of hypoxia. There are two dominant types of hypoxia recognized in tumours, static and intermittent. Both types of hypoxia are important in terms of resistance. A variety of physiological factors cause hypoxia, and in turn, hypoxia can induce genetic and physiological changes. A limited number of studies have documented that hypoxia exists in spontaneous canine tumours. The knowledge from the human literature of problematic nature of hypoxic tumours combined with the rapid growth of veterinary oncology has necessitated a better understanding of hypoxia in canine tumours.

AB BACKGROUND: In addition to neuroprotective genes, the targeted genes of hypoxia-inducible factor la (HIF-1 alpha) include pro-apoptotic genes. However, the influence of HIF-1 alpha on neuronal apoptosis in hypoxia-ischemia remains poorly understood.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between HIF-1 alpha expression and neuronal apoptosis in hypoxia or hypoxia-ischemia brain injury and to determine the role of HIF-1 alpha in regulating neuronal apoptosis.
   DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A randomized, controlled animal experiment was performed at the Laboratory of Children Neurology of Sichuan University between May 2006 and May 2007.
   MATERIALS: In situ cell death detected kit was provided by Roche, USA; rabbit anti-mouse HIF-1 alpha polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, USA; rabbit anti-mouse cleaved caspase-3 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Chemicon, USA.
   METHODS: A total of 36 Sprague Dawley rats aged 10 days were randomly assigned to 3 groups: sham-surgery, hypoxia, and hypoxia-ischemia, with 12 rats per group. The rats were treated at 3 time points: 4, 8 and 24 hours, with 4 rats per time point. In the hypoxia-ischemia group, the right and common carotid artery was exposed and permanently ligated through a midline cervical incision. A 2.5-hour exposure to hypoxia (8% O-2/92% N-2) was used to induce hypoxia-ischemia injury. In the hypoxia group, rats were exposed to hypoxia without ligation of the common carotid artery. In the sham-surgery group, the common carotid artery was exposed without ligation or hypoxia.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histopathological changes, HIF-1 alpha and activated caspase-3 expression, integrated optical density of positive cells, and apoptosis-positive cells.
   RESULTS: Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that neuronal degeneration and edema was most prominent at 24 hours after hypoxia-ischemia. HIF-1 alpha protein expression was significantly upregulated at 4 hours, peaked at 8 hours, and decreased at 24 hours after hypoxia. or hypoxia-ischemia. HIF-1 alpha protein expression was significant greater in the hypoxia and hypoxia-ischemia groups compared with the sham-surgery group (P < 0.01). Activated caspase-3 protein expression began to increase at 4 and 8 hours following hypoxia or hypoxia-ischemia. and was significantly upregulated at 24 hours. Activated caspase-3 protein expression remained at low levels in the sham controls compared with the hypoxia. and hypoxia-ischemia groups (P < 0.01). TUNEL staining showed that the number of apoptotic cells significantly increased at 24 hours after hypoxia or hypoxia-ischemia. In addition, HIF-1 alpha protein expression was greater in the hypoxia. group compared with the hypoxia-ischemia group at the same time point (P < 0.05). However, activated caspase-3 expression and the number of TUNEL-positive cells were less in the hypoxia group compared With the hypoxia-ischemia group at the same time point (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: HIF-1 alpha played a neuroprotective role following hypoxia-ischemia. brain injury.

AB Hypoxia and hypoxia signaling play an integral role in regulating skeletal muscle physiology. Environmental hypoxia and tissue hypoxia in muscles cue for their appropriate physiological response and adaptation, and cause an array of cellular and metabolic changes. In addition, muscle stem cells (satellite cells), exist in a hypoxic state, and this intrinsic hypoxic state correlates with their quiescence and stemness. The mechanisms of hypoxia-mediated regulation of satellite cells and myogenesis are yet to be characterized, and their seemingly contradicting effects reported leave their exact roles somewhat perplexing. This review summarizes the recent findings on the effect of hypoxia and hypoxia signaling on the key aspects of muscle physiology, namely, stem cell maintenance and myogenesis with a particular attention given to distinguish the intrinsic versus local hypoxia in an attempt to better understand their respective regulatory roles and how their relationship affects the overall response. This review further describes their mechanistic links and their possible implications on the relevant pathologies and therapeutics.
   This review summarizes the recent findings on the effect of hypoxia and hypoxia signaling on the key aspects of muscle physiology, namely, stem cell maintenance and myogenesis, and explores some therapeutic potentials of hypoxia signaling modulations. Methods for transiently modulating the hypoxia transcriptional regulators HIF1A and HIF2A can be utilize to promote better overall regenerative outcomes following injuries.image

AB Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disease, which is characterized by occlusive pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) in small pulmonary arteries. It remains unknown whether perinatal insults aggravate occlusive PVD later in life. We tested the hy-pothesis that perinatal hypoxia aggravates PVD and survival in rats. PVD was induced in rats with/without perinatal hypoxia (em-bryonic day 14 to postnatal day 3) by injecting SU5416 at 7 wk of age and subsequent exposure to hypoxia for 3 wk (SU5416/ hypoxia). Hemodynamic and morphological analyses were performed in rats with/without perinatal hypoxia at 7 wk of age (base-line rats, n = 12) and at 15 wk of age in 4 groups of rats: SU5416/hypoxia or control rats with/without perinatal hypoxia (n = 40). Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) from the baseline rats with/without perinatal hypoxia were used to assess cell proliferation, inflammation, and genomic DNA methylation profile. Although perinatal hypoxia alone did not affect survival, physi-ological, or pathological parameters at baseline or at the end of the experimental period in controls, perinatal hypoxia decreased weight gain and survival rate and increased right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, and indices of PVD in SU5416/hypoxia rats. Perinatal hypoxia alone accelerated the proliferation and inflammation of cultured PASMCs from baseline rats, which was associated with DNA methylation. In conclusion, we established the first fatal animal model of PAH with worsen-ing hemodynamics and occlusive PVD elicited by perinatal hypoxia, which was associated with hyperproliferative, proinflamma-tory, and epigenetic changes in cultured PASMCs. These findings provide insights into the treatment and prevention of occlusive PVD.

AB Cancer with a complex pathological process is a major disease to human welfare. Due to the imbalance between oxygen (O-2) supply and consumption, hypoxia is a natural characteristic of most solid tumors and an important obstacle for cancer therapy, which is closely related to tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion. Various strategies to exploit the feature of tumor hypoxia have been developed in the past decade, which can be used to alleviate tumor hypoxia, or utilize the hypoxia for targeted delivery and diagnostic imaging. The strategies to alleviate tumor hypoxia include delivering O-2, in situ O-2 generation, reprogramming the tumor vascular system, decreasing O-2 consumption, and inhibiting HIF-1 related pathways. On the other side, hypoxia can also be utilized for hypoxia-responsive chemical construction and hypoxia-active prodrug-based strategies. Taking advantage of hypoxia in the tumor region, a number of methods have been applied to identify and keep track of changes in tumor hypoxia. Herein, we thoroughly review the recent progress of nanomedicine strategies in both conquering and utilizing hypoxia to combat cancer and put forward the prospect of emerging nanomaterials for future clinical transformation, which hopes to provide perspectives in nanomaterials design.

AB Cells respond to hypoxia via the activation of three isoforms of Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs), that are characterized by different activation times. HIF overexpression has many effects on cell behavior, such as change in metabolism, promotion of angiogenic processes and elicitation of a pro-inflammatory response. These effects are driving forces of malignant progression in cancer cells. In this work we study in detail hypoxia-induced dynamics of HIF1a and HIF2a, which are the most studied isoforms, comparing available experimental data on their evolution in tumor cells with the results obtained integrating the deduced mathematical model. Then, we examine the possible scenarios that characterize the link between hypoxia and inflammation via the activation of NFkB (Nuclear Factor k-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) when the dimensionless groups of parameters of the mathematical model change. In this way we are able to discuss why and when hypoxic conditions lead to acute or chronic inflammatory states.

AB The coordination of the hypoxic response is attributed, in part, to hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (Hif-1 alpha), a regulator of hypoxia-induced transcription. After the teleost-specific genome duplication, most teleost fishes lost the duplicate copy of Hif-1 alpha, except species in the cyprinid lineage that retained both paralogues of Hif-1 alpha (Hif1aa and Hif1ab). Little is known about the contribution of Hif-1 alpha, and specifically of each paralogue, to hypoxia tolerance. Here, we examined hypoxia tolerance in wild-type (Hif1aa(+/+)ab(+/+)) and Hif-1 alpha knockout lines (Hif1aa(-/-); Hif1ab(-/-); Hif1aa(-/-)ab(-/-)) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Critical O-2 tension (P-crit; the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) at which O-2 consumption can no longer be maintained) and time to loss of equilibrium (LOE), two indices of hypoxia tolerance, were assessed in larvae and adults. Knockout of both paralogues significantly increased P-crit (decreased hypoxia tolerance) in larval fish. Prior exposure of larvae to hypoxia decreased P-crit in wild-type fish, an effect mediated by the Hif1aa paralogue. In adults, individuals with a knockout of either paralogue exhibited significantly decreased time to LOE but no difference in P-crit. Together, these results demonstrate that in zebrafish, tolerance to hypoxia and improved hypoxia tolerance after pre-exposure to hypoxia (pre-conditioning) are mediated, at least in part, by Hif-1 alpha.

AB The most immediate response to acute hypoxia in newborn mammals is hyperventilation, like in the adult. However, hyperventilation is often achieved by a reduction in metabolic rate (hypometabolism), rather than by an increase in ventilation (hyperpnea). This response is a regulated phenomenon largely based on inhibition of thermogenesis in all its forms, shivering, non-shivering and behavioural, with a resetting of the thermocontrol at a lower value of body temperature (Tb). Forcing Tb to the normoxic value in an hypoxic newborn can therefore provoke responses that are disadvantageous to the general strategy against hypoxia. The small or absent hyperpnea in the hypoxic newborn is the expected response to the decrease in metabolic rate; therefore, it should not be necessarily regarded as an expression of inadequate ventilatory control. However, during hypoxia the low metabolic rate can enhance the relative efficacy of inputs inhibitory on breathing, and this could be a mechanism contributing to ventilatory irregularities and apneas. The advantages of the hypometabolic strategy are numerous, and are at the basis of the extraordinary ability of newborn mammals to survive periods of severe hypoxia. The disadvantages become apparent with chronic hypoxia, because the reduced growth of tissues and organs may be incompatible with survival, or could lead to long-lasting structural and functional alterations.

AB Tumor hypoxia is one of the main factors compromising the effectiveness of radiotherapy. As a consequence, non-invasive hypoxia imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) is very promising with regard to its potential to provide a functional basis for patient stratification or therapy modification. This review article aims at providing a comprehensive overview of different methodologies for hypoxia PET image acquisition protocols as well as data processing and analysis as used in recent studies and clinical trials. Furthermore, different physical and also technical aspects that may induce ambiguities and limitations into hypoxia PET image acquisition and interpretation are discussed in the context of this article. In the future, dedicated hypoxia PET image acquisition protocols and methodologies for processing, analysis and interpretation of hypoxia PET data are necessary to allow for comparison of hypoxia PET image data acquired in different study centers and enable for the definition of multicenter trials on hypoxia PET imaging and hypoxia-based treatment interventions.

AB Background/Aims: The mechanisms involved in endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by hypoxia are incompletely understood. There is debate about the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) in endothelial barrier disruption. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of genetic overexpression of HIF-la on barrier function and the underlying mechanisms in hypoxic endothelial cells. Methods: The plasmid pcDNA3.1/V5-His-HIF-la was stably transfected into human endothelial cells. The cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia. The mRNA and protein expressions of HIF-la were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot respectively. The barrier function was assessed by measuring the transendothelial electrical resistance (TER). The Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein expression of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1), zonular occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in endothelial cells. The mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines was detected by qRT-PCR. Results: Genetic overexpression of HIF-la significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression of HIF-la in endothelial cells. The overexpression of HIFla enhanced the hypoxia-induced increase of HIF-la and GLUT-1 protein expression. HIFla overexpression not only exacerbated hypoxia-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction but also augmented hypoxia-induced up-regulation of MLCK protein expression. HIF-la overexpression also enhanced IL-l3, IL-6 and TNF-a mRNA expression. Conclusion: We provide evidence that genetic overexpression of HIF-la aggravates the hypoxia-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction via enhancing the up-regulation of MLCK protein expression caused by hypoxia, suggesting a potential role for HIF-la in the pathogenesis of endothelial barrier dysfunction in hypoxia.

AB Projections of stronger and longer-lasting marine heatwaves underscore the emerging need for formalised marine heatwaves response plans to guide response actions at all stages of these extreme events. We present a globally applicable marine heatwave response plan that encompasses four key components, including an early warning system, a response level assessment, response actions and a communication strategy. These overarching components have demonstrated utility for responding to the effects of climate extremes on living marine systems (e.g. coral bleaching), yet monitoring resources and methods, response actions and communications options have not been previously tailored for responding to marine heatwaves. This novel marine heatwave response plan, along with insights gained through its development in response to the anonymously warm 2023/24 Austral summer, contributes to capacity being developed by researchers and managers across numerous jurisdictions facing the emerging need to respond to these climate extremes.

AB Localized hypoxia, the physiological hallmark of many clinical pathologies, is the consequence of acute or chronic ischemia in the affected region or tissue. The versatility, sensitivity, quantitative nature, and increasing availability of positron emission tomography (PET) make it the preclinical and clinical method of choice for functional imaging of tissue hypoxia at the molecular level. The progress and current status of radiotracers for hypoxia-specific PET imaging are reviewed in this article including references mainly focused on radiochemistry and also relevant to molecular imaging of hypoxia in preclinical and clinical studies.

AB We determined whether adenine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) in rats is associated with renal tissue hypoxia. Adenine (100mg) or its vehicle was administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats, daily by oral gavage, over a 15-day period. Renal function was assessed before, and 7 and 14days after, adenine treatment commenced, by collection of a 24-hour urine sample and a blood sample from the tail vein. On day 15, arterial pressure was measured in conscious rats via the tail artery. Renal tissue hypoxia was then assessed by pimonidazole adduct immunohistochemistry and fibrosis was assessed by staining tissue with picrosirius red and Masson's trichrome. CKD was evident within 7days of commencing adenine treatment, as demonstrated by increased urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (30 +/- 12-fold). By day 14 of adenine treatment plasma creatinine concentration was more than 7-fold greater, and plasma urea more than 5-fold greater, than their baseline levels. On day 15, adenine-treated rats had slightly elevated mean arterial pressure (8mmHg), anaemia and renomegaly. Kidneys of adenine-treated rats were characterised by the presence of tubular casts, dilated tubules, expansion of the interstitial space, accumulation of collagen, and tubulointerstitial hypoxia. Pimonidazole staining (hypoxia) co-localised with fibrosis and was present in both patent and occluded tubules. We conclude that renal tissue hypoxia develops rapidly in adenine-induced CKD. This model, therefore, should prove useful for examination of the temporal and spatial relationships between tubulointerstitial hypoxia and the development of CKD, and thus the testing of the chronic hypoxia hypothesis'.

AB Placental hypoxia and increased levels of maternal blood anti-angiogenic protein, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT1), are associated with the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. We have demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2 alpha mediates the upregulation of the hypoxia-induced FLT1 gene in trophoblasts and their cell lines. Here, we investigated the involvement of HIF-1 beta, which acts as a dimerization partner for HIF-alpha, in the upregulation of the FLT1 gene via hypoxia. We confirmed the interactions between HIF-1 beta and HIF-2a in the nuclei of BeWo, JAR and JEG-3 cells under hypoxia via co-immunoprecipitation. We found that hypoxia-induced upregulation of the FLT1 gene in BeWo cells and secretion of sFLT1 in human primary trophoblasts were significantly reduced by siRNAs targeting HIF-1b. Moreover, the upregulation of the FLT1 gene in BeWo cells induced by dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) was also inhibited by silencing either HIF-2 alpha or HIF-1 beta mRNA. It was recently shown that DNA demethylation increases both basal and hypoxia-induced expression levels of the FLT1 gene in three trophoblast-derived cell lines. In the demethylated BeWo cells, siRNAs targeting HIF-2 alpha and HIF-1 beta suppressed the further increase in the expression levels of the FLT1 gene due to hypoxia or treatment with DMOG. However, luciferase reporter assays and bisulfite sequencing revealed that a hypoxia response element (-966 to -962) of the FLT1 gene is not involved in hypoxia or DMOG-induced upregulation of the FLT1 gene. These findings suggest that HIF-1b is essential for the elevated production of sFLT1 in the hypoxic trophoblasts and that the HIF-2 alpha/HIF-1 beta complex may be a crucial therapeutic target for pre-eclampsia.

AB Introduction: Visual performance impairment after hypoxia is well recognized in military and civilian aviation. The aims of this study were: 1) to assess oculometric features such as blink metrics, pupillary dynamics, fixations, and saccades as cognitive indicators of early signs of hypoxia; and 2) to analyze the impact of different hypoxic conditions ['' hypoxic hypoxia '' (HH) and '' socapnic hypoxia '' (IH)] on specified oculometrics during mental workloads. Methods: Oculometric data were collected on 25 subjects under 3 conditions: normoxia, HH (8% O-2 + balance N-2), and IH (7% O-2 + 5% CO2 + balance N-2). The mental workload task consisted of reading aloud linear arrays of numbers after exposure to gas mixtures. Results: Blink rates were significantly increased under hypoxic conditions (by +100.7% in HH and by +92.8% in IH compared to normoxia). A faster recovery of blink rate was observed in transitioning from IH (23.6% vs. 76.3%) to normoxia. The percentage change in pupil size fluctuation was increased under HH more than under IH (29% vs. 4.4%). Under HH average fixation time and target area size were significantly higher than under IH. Total saccadic times under hypoxic conditions were significantly increased compared with normoxia. Conclusions: These results suggest that oculometric changes are indicators of hypoxia, which can be monitored using compact, portable, noninvasive eye-tracking devices in a cockpit analogous environment to detect hypoxia-induced physiological changes in aircrew. Comparative results between HH and IH support the potential role of carbon dioxide in augmenting cerebral perfusion and hence improved tissue oxygen delivery.

AB To investigate whether ginsenoside-Rb1 (Gs-Rb1) inhibits the apoptosis of hypoxia cardiomyocytes by up-regulating apelin-APJ system and whether the system is affected by hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha (Hif-1 alpha).
   Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were randomly divided into 6 groups: a control group, a simple CoCl group, a simple Gs-Rb1 group, a CoCl and Gs-Rb1 hypoxia group, a CoCl and 3-(5'-hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (YC-1) group, a CoCl and YC-1 group and a Gs-Rb1 group, in which YC-1 inhibits the synthesis and accelerates the degradation of Hif-1a. The concentration of CoCl, Gs-Rb1 and YC-1 was 500 mu mol/L, 200 mu mol/L and 5 mu mol/L, respectively; the apoptosis ratio was analyzed with a flow cytometer; and apelin, APJ and Hif-1 alpha were assayed with immunocytochemistry, Western blot assays and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
   (1) The anti-apoptosis effect of Gs-Rb1 on hypoxia cardiomyocytes was significantly inhibited by YC-1; (2) Hypoxia significantly up-graded the expression of mRNA and protein of apelin; this effect was further reinforced by Gs-Rb1 and significantly inhibited by YC-1; (3) Gs-Rb1 further strengthened the expression of APJ mRNA and APJ proteins once hypoxia occurred, which was significantly inhibited by YC-1; (4) Gs-Rb1 significantly increased the expression of Hif-1 alpha, which was completely abolished by YC-1; (5) There was a negative relationship between AR and apelin (or APJ, including mRNA and protein), a positive correlation between apelin (or APJ) protein and Hif-1a protein, in hypoxia cardiomyocytes.
   The apelin-APJ system plays an important role in the anti-apoptosis effect of Gs-Rb1 on hypoxia neonatal cardiomyocytes, which was partly adjusted by Hif-1 alpha.

AB Cadmium is a substantial industrial and environmental pollutant which seriously impairs erythropoiesis. Cd has been demonstrated to aggravate anemia by suppressing erythropoietin gene expression in anemic patients. As hypoxic induction of erythropoietin mRNA depends on a transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), we hypothesized that Cd suppresses the hypoxic activation of HIF-1. In hypoxic Hep3B cells, all mRNAs of various genes, which are known to be upregulated by HIF-1 activation under hypoxia, were suppressed by Cd in a dose-dependent manner. Cd inhibited the hypoxia-induced activity of luciferase in 293 cells which was transfected with a reporter plasmid carrying a hypoxia response element. By electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay, Cd inhibited the DNA-binding activity of HIF-1 in hypoxic Hep3B cells. Cd reduced the amount of HIF-1 alpha protein in hypoxia, whereas it didn't affect HIF-1 alpha mRNA levels. Moreover, Cd inhibited HIF-1 alpha accumulation induced by cobalt and desferrioxamine. Antioxidants and a proteasome inhibitor prevented the HIF-1 alpha degradation caused by Cd. The possibility that oxidative stress mediates this action of Cd was examined. Cd didn't affect protein oxidation and reduced glutathione levels in hypoxic cells. These results indicate that Cd triggers a redox/proteasome-dependent degradation of HIF-1 alpha protein, reducing HIF-1 activity and in turn suppressing the hypoxic induction of hypoxia-inducible genes.

AB Erythrocytes are vital to human adaptation under hypoxic conditions because of their abundance in number and irreplaceable function of delivering oxygen (O-2). However, although multiple large-scale altitude studies investigating the overall coordination of the human body for hypoxia adaptation have been conducted, detailed research with a focus on erythrocytes was missing due to lack of proper techniques. The recently maturing metabolomics profiling technology appears to be the answer to this limitation. Metabolomics profiling provides unbiased high-throughput screening data that reveal the overall metabolic status of erythrocytes. Recent studies have exploited this new technology and provided novel insight into erythrocyte physiology and pathology. In particular, a series of studies focusing on erythrocyte purinergic signaling have reported that adenosine signaling, coupled with 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the production of erythrocyte-enriched bioactive signaling lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate, regulate erythrocyte glucose metabolism for more O-2 delivery. Moreover, an adenosine-dependent "erythrocyte hypoxic memory" was discovered that provides an explanation for fast acclimation upon re-ascent. These findings not only shed new light on our understanding of erythrocyte function and hypoxia adaptation, but also offer a myriad of novel therapeutic possibilities to counteract various hypoxic conditions.

AB Purpose In tumour, the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand leads to hypoxia, which represents a negative prognostic factor associated with aggressive tumour phenotype and therapy resistance. This review provides an overview of the use of positron emitter-labelled radiopharmaceutical used to image hypoxia in preclinical models of cancer.
   Methods A critical and comprehensive PubMed search was performed identifying articles related to PET imaging for hypoxia assessment in preclinical setting from January 2007 up to January 2017.
   Results We have considered and described a total of 54 original articles, exploring tumour-associated hypoxia in preclinical models. Results underlined the potential application together with the advantages and pitfalls of the use of PET in preclinical research. Multi-target imaging allowed to better define the relationship between hypoxia and other biological hallmarks of tumour; imaging of hypoxia was proved as a useful tool for lesions stratification and response prediction to radiotherapy; however, cutoff indexes were identified in few studies. Hypoxia PET showed remarkable tracer delivery limitations in the study of vascular disrupting agents but suggested the potential use of PET as a marker of response or resistance to anti-angiogenics. Finally, the effect of anaesthesia on tracer kinetics and tumour oxygenation as well as perfusion dependency in tracer uptake should be carefully evaluated to avoid artefactual results.
   Conclusions Preclinical studies highlight the advantages and the limitations of the available hypoxia-radiotracers and their potential usefulness for the evaluation of treatments outcome and radiotherapy planning.

AB Hypoxia, a condition of reduced partial pressure of oxygen in tissue, is an important determinant of poor tumor response to radiation treatment. Many invasive and non-invasive methods and approaches have been investigated to detect tumor hypoxia for response prediction and to facilitate modulation of radiation treatment. In this review we discuss the biological consequences of tumor hypoxia, methods of measuring regional tumor hypoxia with positron emission tomography (PET) tracers and applications for radiation oncology.

AB Haematological malignancies are tumours that affect the haematopoietic and the lymphatic systems. Despite the huge efforts to eradicate these tumours, the percentage of patients suffering resistance to therapies and relapse still remains significant. The tumour environment favours drug resistance of cancer cells, and particularly of cancer stem/initiating cells. Hypoxia promotes aggressiveness, metastatic spread and relapse in most of the solid tumours. Furthermore, hypoxia is associated with worse prognosis and resistance to conventional treatments through activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors. Haematological malignancies are not considered solid tumours, and therefore, the role of hypoxia in these diseases was initially presumed to be inconsequential. However, hypoxia is a hallmark of the haematopoietic niche. Here, we will review the current understanding of the role of both hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factors in different haematological tumours.

ID ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS; APOPTOSIS; EXPRESSION; DAMAGE; CELLS
AB Recent reports suggested the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-associated pathway is involved with cognitive impairment in hypoxia condition. ERO1-like protein alpha (Ero1 alpha), an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound N-glycoprotein, has been reported to promote oxidative protein folding. However, no studies have reported whether the Ero1 alpha is trapped in hypoxia-induced neuronal loss through the ERS-associated pathways. In our study, this effect of Ero1 alpha was investigated using C57BL/6J mice, the HT22 cells and primary rat neurons. C57BL/6J mice were modeled in a hypoxic chamber for 4 weeks. Behavioral tests were then carried out to test cognitive functions, including the Morris water maze and fear conditioning test. Proteomics showed that Ero1 alpha distinctly upregulated compared with normoxia group and verified using western blotting. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to analyze the neuroprotective effect of inhibitor EN460 of Ero1 alpha in the HT22 cells. In C57BL/6J mice, hypoxia significantly caused cognitive decline. Brain slice staining results were also used to confirm this effect. Western blot analysis demonstrated that Ero1 alpha, ERS-associated proteins and apoptosis-associated proteins significantly increased in the hypoxia treated groups, further proliferation-related marker protein decreased. EN460, a selective endoplasmic reticulum oxidation 1 (ERO1) inhibitor, counteracted neuronal apoptosis and ameliorated neuronal cell proliferation in the HT22 cells. Taken together, our data indicate that hypoxia induces cognitive impairment, at least in part, by upregulating Ero1 alpha which contributes to neuronal apoptosis through ERS signaling pathway, providing preliminary experimental evidence that the Ero1 alpha is a promising therapeutic target in hypoxia-induced cognitive deficits.

AB Low oxygen tension, i.e., hypoxia, is a pathophysiological component involved in many human disorders but is also a critically important phenomenon in normal development and differentiation. The ability of cells to survive under hypoxia or to adapt to it depends on a family of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) that induce the expression of a number of genes involved in hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, iron transport, glucose utilization, resistance to oxidative stress, cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis, and extracellular matrix homeostasis. We introduce here the recently identified molecular mechanisms responsible for the oxygen-dependent stability and activity of HIF, after which we focus on extracellular matrix genes as HIF targets. The vital role of the hypoxia response pathway in chondrogenesis and joint development is then discussed.

Persisting mild hypothermia suppresses hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha protein synthesis and hypoxia-inducible factor-1-mediated gene expression. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 298: R661-R671, 2010. First published December 30, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00732.2009.-The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) plays an essential role in regulating gene expression in response to hypoxia-ischemia. Ischemia causes the tissue not only to be hypoxic but also to be hypothermic because of the hypoperfusion under certain circumstances. On the other hand, the induced hypothermia is one of the most common therapeutic modalities to extend tolerance to hypoxia. Although hypoxia elicits a variety of cellular and systemic responses at different organizational levels in the body, little is known about how hypoxia-induced responses are affected by low temperature. We examined the influence of mild hypothermic conditions (28-32 degrees C) on HIF-1 in both in vitro and in vivo settings. In vitro experiments adopting cultured cells elucidated that hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activation was resistant to 4-h exposure to the low temperature. In contrast, exposure to the low temperature as long as 24 h suppressed HIF-1 activation and the subsequent upregulation of HIF-1 target genes such as VEGF or GLUT-1. HIF-1 alpha protein stability in the cell was not affected by hypothermic treatment. Furthermore, intracellular ATP content was reduced under 1% O-2 conditions but was not largely affected by hypothermic treatment. The evidence indicates that reduction of oxygen consumption is not largely involved in suppression of HIF-1. In addition, we demonstrated that HIF-1 DNA-binding activity and HIF-1-dependent gene expressions induced under 10% O-2 atmosphere in mouse brain were not influenced by treatment under 3-h hypothermic temperature but were inhibited under 5-h treatment. On the other hand, we indicated that warming ischemic legs of mice for 24 h preserved HIF-1 activity. In this report we describe for the first time that persisting low temperature significantly reduced HIF-1 alpha neosynthesis under hypoxic conditions, leading to a decrease in gene expression for adaptation to hypoxia in both in vitro and in vivo settings.

AB Adaptation of organisms to stressors is coordinated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), which involves glucocorticoids (GCs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). Although the effects of GCs are well characterized, their impact on brain adaptation to hypoxia/ischemia is still understudied. The brain is not only the most susceptible to hypoxic injury, but also vulnerable to GC-induced damage, which makes studying the mechanisms of brain hypoxic tolerance and resistance to stress-related elevation of GCs of great importance. Cross-talk between the molecular mechanisms activated in neuronal cells by hypoxia and GCs provides a platform for developing the most effective and safe means for prevention and treatment of hypoxia-induced brain damage, including hypoxic pre- and post-conditioning. Taking into account that hypoxia- and GC-induced reprogramming significantly affects the development of organisms during embryogenesis, studies of the effects of prenatal and neonatal hypoxia on health in later life are of particular interest. This mini review discusses the accumulated data on the dynamics of the HPA activation in injurious and non-injurious hypoxia, the role of the brain GRs in these processes, interaction of GCs and hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1, as well as cross-talk between GC and hypoxic signaling. It also identifies underdeveloped areas and suggests directions for further prospective studies.

AB Blood flow increases to exercising skeletal muscle, and this increase is driven primarily by vasodilation in the contracting muscles. When oxygen delivery to the contracting muscles is altered by changes in arterial oxygen content, the magnitude of the vasodilator response to exercise changes. It is augmented during hypoxia and blunted during hyperoxia. Because the magnitude of the increased vasodilation during hypoxic exercise tends to keep oxygen delivery to the contracting muscles constant, we have termed this phenomenon "compensatory vasodilation." In a series of studies, we have explored metabolic, endothelial, and neural mechanisms that might contribute to compensatory vasodilation. These include the contribution of vasodilating substances like nitric oxide (NO) and adenosine, along with altered interactions between sympathetic vasoconstriction and metabolic vasodilation. We have also compared the compensatory vasodilator responses to hypoxic exercise with those seen when oxygen delivery to contracting muscles is altered by acute reductions in perfusion pressure. A synthesis of our findings indicate that NO contributes to the compensatory dilator responses during both hypoxia and hypoperfusion, while adenosine appears to contribute only during hypoperfusion. During hypoxia, the NO-mediated component is linked to a beta-adrenergic receptor mechanism during lower intensity exercise, while another source of NO is engaged at higher exercise intensities. There are also subtle interactions between beta-adrenergic vasoconstriction and metabolic vasodilation that influence the responses to hypoxia, hyperoxia, and hypoperfusion. Together our findings emphasize both the tight linkage of oxygen demand and supply during exercise and the redundant nature of the vasomotor responses to contraction.

AB Tumor hypoxic microenvironment contributes to AZD9291 (osimertinib) resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Developing hypoxia-triggered theranostic formulation for simultaneous hypoxia tumor imaging and oxygen-independent photothermal therapy (PTT) will be an effective strategy to overcome AZD9291 resistance under hypoxic conditions. Herein, we designed and synthesized a boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dye-modified chitosan (CsB) linked through a hypoxia-responsive azobenzene group and fabricated a nanoplatform CsBANs self-assembled by CsB and AZD9291 to achieve hypoxia-responsive imaging and synergistic PTT/targeted mo-lecular therapy. CsBANs exhibited excellent cellular uptake efficiency and hypoxia imaging capacity either in two-dimensional NSCLC cell cultures under hypoxia or in multicellular tumor spheroids. The in vitro and in vivo results showed that the photothermal effects of BODIPY and AZD9291 could induce satisfactory anticancer ef-fects in NSCLC cell lines and in xenograft mouse model. Hence, this work presents a promising hypoxia-activated nanotheranostic platform to deal with hypoxia-induced AZD9291 resistance and for other hypoxia-related diseases.

AB Tumor hypoxia has been commonly observed in a broad spectrum of primary solid malignancies. Hypoxia is associated with tumor progression, increased aggressiveness, enhanced metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Hypoxic tumor cells are resistant to radiotherapy and some forms of chemotherapy. Using an animal model, we recently showed that microscopic tumors less than I mm diameter were severely hypoxic. In this review, models and techniques for the study of hypoxia in microscopic tumors are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent sleep disorder considered as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular consequences, such as systemic arterial hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, metabolic disorders, and cognitive dysfunction. The pathogenesis of OSA-related consequence is assumed to be chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) inducing alterations at the molecular level, oxidative stress, persistent systemic inflammation, oxygen sensor activation, and increase of sympathetic activity. Overall, these mechanisms have an effect on vessel permeability and are considered to be important factors for explaining vascular, metabolic, and cognitive OSA-related consequences. The present review attempts to examine together the research paradigms and clinical studies on the effect of acute and chronic IH and the potential link with OSA. We firstly describe the literature data on the mechanisms activated by acute and chronic IH at the experimental level, which are very helpful and beneficial to explaining OSA consequences. Then, we describe in detail the effect of IH in patients with OSA that we can consider "the human model" of chronic IH. In this way, we can better understand the specific pathophysiological mechanisms proposed to explain the consequences of IH in OSA.

AB Investigations studying the secretion of EPO (erythropoietin) in response to acute hypoxia have produced mixed results. Further, the errors associated with the various methods used to determine EPO are not well documented. The purpose of the current study was to determine the EPO response of 17 trained male subjects to either an acute bout of normobaric hypoxia (Hy; n = 10) or normoxia (Con; n = 7). A secondary aim was to determine the error associated with the measurement of EPO. After baseline tests, the treatment group (Hy) underwent a single bout of hypoxic exposure (F-IO2 similar to 0.148; 3100 m) consisting of a 90-min rest period followed by a 30-min exercise phase (50% V-O2max). Venous blood samples were drawn pre (0 min) and post (120 min) each test to assess changes in plasma EPO (Delta EPO). The control (Con) group was subjected to the same general experimental design, but placed in a normoxic environment (F-IO2 similar to 0.2093). The Hy group demonstrated a mean increase in EPO [19.3 (4.4) vs. 24.1 (5.1) mU/mL], p < 0.04, post 120 min of normobaric hypoxia. The calculated technical error of measurement for EPO was 2.1 mU/mL (9.8%). It was concluded that an acute bout of hypoxia, has the capacity to elevate plasma EPO. This study also demonstrates that the increase in EPO accumulation was 2 times greater than the calculated measurement of error.

AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) exhibit self-renewal capacity and multilineage differentiation potential, making them attractive for research and clinical application. The properties of MSC can vary depending on specific micro-environmental factors. MSC resides in specific niches with low oxygen concentrations, where oxygen functions as a metabolic substrate and a signaling molecule. Conventional physical incubators or chemically hypoxia mimetic agents are applied in cultures to mimic the original low oxygen tension settings where MSC originated.This review aims to focus on the current knowledge of the effects of various physical hypoxic conditions and widely used hypoxia-mimetic agents-PHD inhibitors on mesenchymal stem cells at a cellular and molecular level, including proliferation, stemness, differentiation, viability, apoptosis, senescence, migration, immunomodulation behaviors, as well as epigenetic changes.

AB The respiratory effects of graded hypoxia were determined in 8 rabbits on postnatal days 1, 6 and 21.  Ventilation was measured in the unanesthetized state by plethysmography.  Graded hypoxia was produced by reducing the fraction of inspired O2 to 0.15 (mild hypoxia) for 15 min and then lowering it further to 0.10 (moderate hypoxia) for another 15 min.  Mild hypoxia initially stimulated breathing to the same extent in all 3 groups; however, with moderate hypoxia, the percent increase in ventilation was greater for older rabbits.  The rise in ventilation was due to an increase in tidal volume and frequency in 1 - and 21-day-old rabbits, and it was almost entirely the result of changes in frequency in 6-day-old rabbits.  After 2-3 min of hypoxia (mild or moderate), a decline in ventilation was observed in all 3 groups.  This reduction of respiration was greater in younger animals and with moderate hypoxia.  Decreases in frequency and tidal volume contributed significantly to this fall in ventilation for 1- and 2-day-old rabbits.  However, the fall in ventilation for 6-day-old pups occurred almost entirely by changes in tidal volume.  It is concluded that the magnitude of phase 1 (increased ventilation) and phase 2 (decreased ventilation) responses to hypoxia depend upon the level of hypoxia and the age of the rabbit.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hypoxia may play a role in the survival of ectopic endometrial cells. This study aimed to explore how hypoxia responsive miR-210 is involved in cell survival and autophagic response of endometriotic cells.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and miR-210 in eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues were measured. The expression changes of HIF-1 alpha and miR-210 in ovarian endometriotic cell line CRL-7566 after hypoxic culture were further explored. The influence of miR-210 on cell viability and apoptosis was quantified using CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis. The effect of miR-210 on Bcl-2 expression and the effect of miR-210/Bcl-2 axis on autophagy in the cells were measured by Western blot analysis.
   RESULTS: Ectopic lesion had stronger HIF-1 alpha positive signals, as well as more HIF-1 alpha positive cells per visual field than the eutopic endometrium. MiR-210 expression was also elevated in the ectopic lesions. In in-vitro models, CRL-7566 cells had significantly higher expression of HIF-1 alpha and miR-210 after hypoxic treatment. MiR-210 overexpression partly preserved cell viability in hypoxia, while miR-210 knockdown facilitated the loss of cell viability. In addition, miR-210 significantly attenuated hypoxia-induced apoptosis in CRL-7566 cells. Enforced miR-210 overexpression significantly promoted autophagy in hypoxia. Knockdown of endogenous Bcl-2 significantly enhanced autophagy, the effect of which was similar to that of miR-210.
   CONCLUSIONS: The hypoxia-induced higher miR-210 expression may contribute to pathological development of endometriosis at least through enhancing cell survival and promoting autophagy via Bcl2/Beclin-1 axis.

AB Hypoxia (insufficient O-2 availability) is involved in various biological processes, such as tumorigenesis and inflammation. Hypoxia results in stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) including HIF1a and HIF2 alpha. Here we describe a protocol to detect mouse and human tissue hypoxia by using Hypoxyprobe and immunohistochemical staining for HIF1 alpha and HIF2 alpha.

AB Hypoxia is a key hallmark of solid tumors and can cause resistance to various treatments such as photodynamics and immunotherapy. Microenvironment-responsive gene editing provides a powerful tool to overcome hypoxia resistance and remodel hypoxic microenvironments for enhanced tumor therapy. Here, a light-enhanced hypoxia-responsive multifunctional nanocarrier is developed to perform spatiotemporal specific dual gene editing for enhanced photodynamic and immunotherapy in breast cancer. As a gated molecule of nanocarrier, the degradation of azobenzene moieties under hypoxic conditions triggers controllable release of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein in hypoxic site of the tumor. Hyaluronic acid is conjugated with chloramine e6 to coat mesoporous silica nanoparticles for targeted delivery in tumors and generation of high levels of reactive oxygen species, which can result in increased hypoxia levels for effective cleavage of azobenzene bonds to improve gene editing efficiency and reduce toxic side effects with light irradiation. Moreover, dual targeting HIF-1 alpha and PD-L1 in the anoxic microenvironments can overcome hypoxia resistance and remodel immune microenvironments, which reduces tumor plasticity and resistance to photodynamic and immunotherapy. In summary, a light-enhanced hypoxia responsive nanocomposite is developed for controllable gene editing which holds great promise for synergistic hypoxia-resistant photodynamic and immunotherapy.
   MA@Cas-HP@HC can reshape the tumor immune microenvironment. Development of a light-enhanced hypoxia-responsive CRISPR-Cas9 delivery system is introduced to overcome hypoxia resistance for cancer therapy.image

AB Investigation into the regulation of the erythropoietin gene by oxygen led to the discovery of a process of direct oxygen sensing that transduces many cellular and systemic responses to hypoxia. The oxygen-sensitive signal is generated through the catalytic action of a series of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases that regulate the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) by the post-translational hydroxylation of specific amino acid residues. Here we review the implications of the unforeseen complexity of the HIF transcriptional cascade for the physiology and pathophysiology of hypoxia, and consider the origins of post-translational hydroxylation as a signaling process.

AB This study examined the effects of five nights of normobaric hypoxia on ventilatory responses to acute isocapnic hypoxia (AHVR) and hyperoxic hypercapnia (AHCVR). Twelve male subjects (26.6+/-4.1 years, standard deviation (S.D.)) slept 8-9 h per day overnight for 5 consecutive days at a simulated altitude of 4300 in (FiO(2) = similar to 13.8%). Using the technique of dynamic end-tidal forcing, the AHVR and AHCVR were assessed twice prior to, immediately after, and 5 days following the hypoxic exposure. Immediately following the exposure, AHVR was increased by 1.6+/-1.3 L min(-1)%(-1) (P < 0.01) when compared with control values. Likewise, after the exposure, ventilation in hyperoxia was increased (P < 0.001) and was associated with both an increase in the slope (1.5+/-1.4 L min(-1) Torr(-1); P < 0.05) and decrease in the intercept (-2.7+/-4.3 Torr; P < 0.05) of the AHCVR. These results show that five nights of hypoxia can elicit similar perturbations, in both AHVR and AHCVR, as have been reported during more chronic altitude exposures.

AB The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays a critical role in cellular responses to hypoxia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate which genes are induced by hypoxia, and whether this induction is mediated by HIF-1, by expression microarray analysis of wt and HIF-1 alpha null mouse fibroblasts. Forty-five genes were up-regulated by hypoxia and 40 (89%) of these were regulated by HIF-1. Of the 114 genes down-regulated by hypoxia, 19 (17%) were HIF-1-dependent. All glycolytic enzymes were strongly up-regulated by hypoxia in a HIF-1-dependent manner. Genes already known to be related to hypoxia, such as glucose transporter 1, BNIP3, and hypoxia-induced gene 1, were induced. In addition, multiple new HIF-1-regulated genes were identified, including genes involved in metabolism (adenylate kinase 4, galactokinase), apoptosis (galectin-3 and gelsolin), and invasion (RhoA). Genes down-regulated by hypoxia were involved in cytoskeleton maintenance (Rho kinase), mRNA processing (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 and splicing factor), and DNA repair (REV3). Furthermore, seven cDNAs from genes with unknown function or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were up-regulated and 27 such cDNAs were down-regulated. In conclusion, hypoxia causes down- rather than up-regulation of gene expression and HIF-1 seems to play a major role in the regulation of hypoxia-induced genes.

AB This mini-review summarizes the physiological adaptations to and pathophysiological consequences of intermittent hypoxia with special emphasis given to the pathophysiology associated with obstructive sleep apnea. Intermittent hypoxia is an effective stimulus for evoking the respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic adaptations normally associated with continuous chronic hypoxia. These adaptations are thought by some to be beneficial in that they may provide protection against disease as well as improve exercise performance in athletes. The long-term consequences of chronic intermittent hypoxia may have detrimental effects, including hypertension, cerebral and coronary vascular problems, developmental and neurocognitive deficits, and neurodegeneration due to the cumulative effects of persistent bouts of hypoxia. Emphasis is placed on reviewing the available data on intermittent hypoxia, making extensions from applicable information from acute and chronic hypoxia studies, and pointing out major gaps in information linking the genomic and cellular responses to intermittent hypoxia with physiological or pathophysiological responses.

AB Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a hypoxia-inducible protein with cytoprotective effects in animal models of stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and related disorders, but the molecular mechanisms involved in its induction are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) regulates Ngb levels, using shRNA-mediated knockdown and lentiviral vector-mediated overexpression of the HIF-1 alpha sub-unit, in cultured neural (HN33) cells. HIF-1 alpha knockdown decreased and HIF-1 alpha overexpression increased Ngb levels, consistent with a connection between HIF-1 and Ngb induction. These findings may have implications for understanding the hypoxia-response repertoire of neural cells and devising therapeutic strategies for neurologic disorders. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB IntroductionImmune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has been proven to be a highly efficacious treatment for colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD). However, it is still unclear how to identify those who might benefit the most from ICI therapy. Hypoxia facilitates the progression of the tumor from different aspects, including proliferation, metabolism, angiogenesis, and migration, and improves resistance to ICI. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive understanding of the influences of hypoxia in COAD and identify a biomarker for predicting the benefit of ICI. MethodsAn unsupervised consensus clustering algorithm was used to identify distinct hypoxia-related patterns for COAD patients from TCGA and the GEO cohorts. The ssGSEA algorithm was then used to explore the different biological processes, KEGG pathways, and immune characteristics among distinct hypoxia-related clusters. Some hypoxia-related hub genes were then selected by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). Subsequently, univariate Cox regression analysis, multivariate Cox regression analysis, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were utilized to construct a hypoxia-related gene prognostic index (HRGPI). Finally, validation was also conducted for HRGPI in prognostic value, distinguishing hypoxia-related characteristics and benefits of ICI. ResultsWe identified four hypoxia-related clusters and found that different hypoxia response patterns induced different prognoses significantly. Again, we found different hypoxia response patterns presented distinct characteristics of biological processes, signaling pathways, and immune features. Severe hypoxia conditions promoted activation of some cancer-related signaling pathways, including Wnt, Notch, ECM-related pathways, and remodeled the tumor microenvironment of COAD, tending to present as an immune-excluded phenotype. Subsequently, we selected nine genes (ANO1, HOXC6, SLC2A4, VIP, CD1A, STC2, OLFM2, ATP6V1B1, HMCN2) to construct our HRGPI, which has shown an excellent prognostic value. Finally, we found that HRGPI has an advantage in distinguishing immune and molecular characteristics of hypoxia response patterns, and it could also be an excellent predictive indicator for clinical response to ICI therapy. ConclusionDifferent hypoxia response patterns activate different signaling pathways, presenting distinct biological processes and immune features. HRGPI is an independent prognostic factor for COAD patients, and it could also be used as an excellent predictive indicator for clinical response to ICI therapy.

AB The hypoxic microenvironment is one of the major features of solid tumors, which regulates cell malignancy in multiple ways. As a response to hypoxia, a large number of target genes involved in cell growth, metabolism, metastasis and immunity are activated in cancer cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), as a heterodimeric DNA-binding complex, is comprised of a constitutively expressed HIF-1 beta subunit and an oxygen sensitive HIF-1 alpha subunit, thus, adapts to decreased oxygen availability as a transcriptional factor. HIF-1 regulates many genes involved in tumorigenesis. Here, we focus on cancer cell metabolism and metastasis regulated by hypoxia.

AB The world's highest and largest altitude area is called the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau QTP, which harbors unique animal and plant species. Mammals that inhabit the higher altitude regions have adapted well to the hypoxic conditions. One of the main stressor at high altitudes is hypoxia. Metabolic responses to hypoxia play important roles in cell survival strategies and some diseases. However, the homeostatic alterations that equilibrate variations in the demand and supply of energy to maintain organismal function in a prolonged low O-2 environment persist partly in understood, making it problematic to differentiate adaptive from maladaptive responses in hypoxia. Tibetans and yaks are two perfect examples innate to the plateau for high altitude adaptation. By the scan of the whole-genome, EPAS1 and EGLN1 were identified as key genes associated with sustained hemoglobin concentration in high altitude mammals for adaptation. The yak is a much more ancient mammal that has existed on QTP longer than humans. It is, therefore, possible that natural selection represented a diverse group of genes/pathways in yaks. Physiological characteristics are extremely informative in revealing molecular networks associated with inherited adaptation, in addition to the whole-genome adaptive changes at the DNA sequence level. Gene-expression can be changed by a variety of signals originating from the environment, and hypoxia is the main factor amongst them. The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1 alpha and EPAS1/HIF-2 alpha) are the main regulators of oxygen in homeostasis, which play a role as maestro regulators of adaptation in the hypoxic reaction of molecular mechanisms. The basis of this review is to present recent information regarding the molecular mechanism involved in hypoxia that regulates candidate genes and proteins. Many transcriptional responses toward hypoxia are facilitated by HIFs that change the number of gene expressions and help in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, metabolic reprogramming, and metastasis. HIFs also activate several signals highlighting a strong association between hypoxia, the misfolded proteins' accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum in stress, and activation of Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). It was observed that at high-altitudes, pregnancies yield a low birth weight 100 g per1000 m of the climb. It may involve variation in the events of energy-demand, like protein synthesis. Prolonged hypobaric hypoxia causes placental ER stress, which, in turn, moderates protein synthesis and reduces proliferation. Further, Cardiac hypertrophy by cytosolic Ca2+ raises and Ca2+/calmodulin, calcineurin stimulation, NF-AT3 pathway might be caused by an imbalance in Sarcoplasmic reticulum ER Ca2+, which might be adaptive in the beginning but severe later on.

AB Central nervous system-based cancers have a much higher mortality rate with the 2016 estimates at 6.4 for incidence and 4.3 for deaths per 100,000 individuals. Grade IV astrocytomas, known as glioblastomas are highly aggressive and show a high proliferation index, diffused infiltration, angiogenesis, microvascular proliferation and pleomorphic vessels, resistance to apoptosis, and pseudopalisading necrosis. Extensive hypoxic regions in glioblastomas contribute to the highly malignant phenotype of these tumors. Hypoxic regions of glioblastoma exacerbate the prognosis and clinical outcomes of the patients as hypoxic tumor cells are resistant to chemo- and radiation therapy and are also protected by the malfunctional vasculature that developed due to hypoxia. Predominantly, hypoxia-inducible factor-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor, transforming growth factor-, epidermal growth factor receptor and PI3 kinase/Akt signaling systems are involved in tumor progression and growth. Glioblastomas are predominantly glycolytic and hypoxia-induced factors are useful in the metabolic reprogramming of these tumors. Abnormal vessel formation is crucial in generating pseudopalisading necrosis regions that protect cancer stem cells residing in that region from therapeutic agents and this facilitates the cancer stem cell niche to expand and contribute to cell proliferation and tumor growth. Therapeutic approaches that target hypoxia-induced factors, such as use of the monoclonal antibody against VEGF, bevacizumab, have been useful only in stabilizing the disease but failed to increase overall survival. Hypoxia-activated TH-302, a nitroimidazole prodrug of cytotoxin bromo-isophosphoramide mustard, appears to be more attractive due to its better beneficial effects in glioblastoma patients. A better understanding of the hypoxia-mediated protection of glioblastoma cells is required for developing more effective therapeutics.

AB Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of Kaposi sarcoma and several other tumors and hyperproliferative diseases seen predominantly in human immunodeficiency virus-infected and other immunocompromised persons. There is an increasing body of evidence showing that hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play important roles in the biology of KSHV and in the pathogenesis of KSHV-induced diseases. Hypoxia and HIFs can induce lytic activation of KSHV and KSHV can in turn lead to a hypoxic-like state in infected cells. In this review, we describe the complex interactions between KSHV biology, the cellular responses to hypoxia, and the pathogenesis of KSHV-induced diseases. We also describe how interference with HIFs can lead to decreased tumor growth and/or death of infected cells and KSHV-induced tumors. Finally, we show how these observations may lead to novel strategies for the treatment of KSHV-induced diseases.

AB Hypoxia in solid tumors is an important predictor of treatment resistance and poor clinical outcome. The significance of hypoxia in the development of resistance to radiotherapy has been recognized for decades and the search for hypoxia-targeting, radiosensitizing agents continues. This review summarizes the main hypoxia-related processes relevant for radiotherapy on the subcellular, cellular and tissue level and discusses the significance of hypoxia in radiation oncology, especially with regard to the current shift towards hypofractionated treatment regimens. Furthermore, we discuss the strategies to interfere with hypoxia for radiotherapy optimization, and we highlight novel insights into the molecular pathways involved in hypoxia that might be utilized to increase the efficacy of radiotherapy.

AB Recent data suggest that hypoxia and its principal molecular signature HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducing factor-1) may tune down inflammation by dictating anti-inflammatory programs. We tested the effects of hypoxia and HIF-1 alpha on the homeostasis of naturally occurring regulatory T cells (Treg) and their transcriptional activator Foxp3. Hypoxia induced a time-dependent increase in HIF-1 alpha in mouse and human T cells. Hypoxia upregulated the expression of Foxp3 in Jurkat T cells, human and murine mononuclear cells. The effects of hypoxia on Foxp3 expression were HIF-1 alpha-dependent as they were abolished upon transfection with short-interfering RNAs for HIF-1 alpha and promoted by HIF-1 alpha over-expression. Hypoxia increased the potency of Treg, as hypoxic CD4(+)CD25(+) lymphocytes were more effective than normoxic cells in suppressing the proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) effectors. In vivo expression of HIF-1 alpha achieved by hydrodynamic injection of the respective naked DNA similarly induced an increase in Foxp3 expression and an increase in the number of functionally active Foxp3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg. Thus, hypoxia dictates an anti-inflammatory program by driving expression of HIF-1 alpha that acts to increase the number and suppressive properties of naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg.

AB Tumor hypoxia is the result of an inadequate supply of oxygen to tumor cells which can be caused by multiple factors. It is associated with aggressive local tumor growth and invasion, increased risk of metastasis, higher resistance to radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy, overall resulting in a poor clinical prognosis. Many locally advanced solid tumors may exhibit hypoxic and/or anoxic tissue areas that are heterogeneously distributed within the tumor mass. As hypoxia is a negative prognostic factor concerning response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, in vivo measurement of tumor hypoxia could be helpful to identify patients with worse prognosis or patients that could benefit from appropriate treatments such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) that may accurately conform the dose distribution to small intratumoral regions showing differences in the oxygen level. A manifold of different methods to assess the oxygen tension (pO(2)) in tissues have been developed, each of them offering advantages as well as drawbacks. They range from invasive direct measurement techniques of the pO(2) in tissue by using a polarographic electrode, to non-invasive imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This article provides an overview over the various methods, with a particular emphasis on PET and MRI for imaging of hypoxia, and reviews their performance in preclinical and clinical studies.

AB Exposure to an adverse intrauterine environment increases the risk of cardiovascular disease later in adult life. It has been shown that hypoxia plays a critical role in vascular remodeling and directly affects vascular smooth muscle cells functions. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of hypoxia on neonatal rat aorta smooth muscle cells (NRSMCs). Our study demonstrated that hypoxia stimulation at 2% oxygen could significantly enhance NRSMCs proliferation in a time dependent manner. Moreover, hypoxia treatment resulted in an increased percentage in the S + G2/M phase and decreased apoptosis rate in NRSMCs. On the molecular level, the protein levels of pro-apoptotic proteins BNIP3 and bax were obviously reduced, while the anti-apoptotic factor bcl-2 was enhanced under hypoxia condition. Furthermore, we found that hypoxia activated hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) expression and subsequently promoted NRSMCs proliferation. Specific down-regulation of HIF-1 alpha partly abolished the proliferative effect of hypoxia on NRSMCs growth. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that hypoxia treatment promoted NRSMCs growth through activation of HIF-1 alpha, which may contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

AB We have previously reported that 5 copies of the hypoxia response element (H RE) can conditionally regulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene expression under hypoxic/ischemic conditions in mice. In the present study, we investigated the controlled expression of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) by H RE under hypoxic conditions and determined the protective effects of conditionally expressed NT-3 on hypoxia-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. Five copies of the HRE (5HRE) and the simian virus 40 minimal promoter (SV40mp) were employed to construct a cassette, and transfer of therapeutic gene, NT-3, into PC12 cells was achieved using a retroviral vector. Our results showed that the retroviral vector, pLNC-5HRE-NT3, was successfully constructed and transfected into PC12 cells. Compared with normal conditions, in which NT-3 was expressed at low levels, the expression of NT-3 significantly increased under hypoxic conditions in 5HRE-NT3 transgenic PC12 cells (P<0.05). By contrast, in NT-3 transgenic PC12 cells without HRE, we found no significant difference in NT-3 expression between the normoxic and hypoxic groups. The conditional adjustment of NT-3 expression by 5HRE significantly reduced apoptosis induced by hypoxia in 5HRE-NT3 transgenic PC12 cells (P<0.05) but not in 5HRE-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgenic PC12 cells and PC12 cells without gene transfer. In addition, the hypoxia-induced upregulation of both p38 and caspase-3 activities was suppressed in 5HRE-NT3 transgenic PC12 cells under hypoxic conditions (P<0.05). Taken together, these results demonstrate that 5HRE-SV40mp regulates NT-3 gene expression in response to hypoxia in PC12 cells. The data presented in this study may prove useful in future gene therapy studies for the treatment of ischemic diseases.

AB Hypoxia, a hallmark of most solid tumours, is a negative prognostic factor due to its association with an aggressive tumour phenotype and therapeutic resistance. Given its prominent role in oncology, accurate detection of hypoxia is important, as it impacts on prognosis and could influence treatment planning. A variety of approaches have been explored over the years for detecting and monitoring changes in hypoxia in tumours, including biological markers and noninvasive imaging techniques. Positron emission tomography (PET) is the preferred method for imaging tumour hypoxia due to its high specificity and sensitivity to probe physiological processes in vivo, as well as the ability to provide information about intracellular oxygenation levels. This review provides an overview of imaging hypoxia with PET, with an emphasis on the advantages and limitations of the currently available hypoxia radiotracers.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms of hypoxia-induced apoptosis of GC-2spd (GC-2) cells. The GC-2 cells were treated with or without hypoxia for 12, 24, 48, and 72h. Apoptosis of GC-2 cells was detected using TUNEL and flow cytometry. Fluorescence microscopic was used to observe the autophagy of GC-2 cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1), apoptosis-related protein and marker protein of autophagy levels were measured by Western blotting. Hypoxia induced apoptosis and autophagy of GC-2 cells, and increased expression of HIF-1, LC3-II, Beclin-1, and pro-apoptotic protein, but reduced p62 and anti-apoptotic protein level. Meanwhile, hypoxia-induced HIF-1 mediated expression of apoptosis and autophagy-related protein in GC-2 cell. Furthermore, autophagy regulated hypoxia-induced apoptosis of GC-2 cell. Our data suggest that hypoxia induces apoptosis of GC-2 cell by activation of autophagy involving activation of the apoptosis signaling pathway under the hypoxic condition.

AB Exposure to hypoxia triggers a variety of adverse effects in the brain that arise from metabolic stress and induce neuron apoptosis. Overexpression of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is believed to be a major candidate in orchestrating the cell's defense against stress. To test the impact of HIF-1 alpha on apoptosis during chronic hypoxia in vivo, we examined the protective effect of modulating the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP pathway by sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5). Male ICR/CD-1 mice were divided into 3 groups (n = 6/group): normoxic (21% O-2), hypoxic (9.5% O-2), and hypoxic with sildenafil (1.4-mg/kg intraperitoneal injections daily). At the end of the 8-day treatment period, the mice were euthanized and cerebral cortex biopsies were harvested for analyses. We found that sildenafil: (1) did not significantly alter the hypoxia-induced weight loss and hemoglobin increase, but did augment plasma nitrates+nitrites and the tissue content of cGMP and phosphorylated (P) NO synthase III; (2) reversed the hypoxia-induced neuron apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase positivity and double-staining immunofluorescence, P = 0.009), presumably through increased bcl-2/Bax (P = 0.0005); and (3) did not affect HIF-1 alpha, but rather blunted the hypoxia-induced increase in P-ERK1/2 (P = 0.0002) and P-p38 (P = 0.004). We conclude that upregulating the NO/cGMP pathway by PDE-5 inhibition during hypoxia reduces neuron apoptosis, regardless of HIF-1 alpha, through an interaction involving ERK1/2 and p38.

AB The role of hypoxia in radiation resistance is well established and many approaches to overcome hypoxia in tumours have been explored, with variable success. Two small molecule strategies for targeting hypoxia have dominated preclinical and clinical efforts. One approach has been the use of electron-affinic nitro-heterocycles as oxygen-mimetic sensitisers. These agents are best exemplified by the 5-nitroimidazole nimorazole, which has limited use in conjunction with radiotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The second approach seeks to leverage tumour hypoxia as a tumour-specific address for hypoxia-activated prodrugs. These prodrugs are selectively activated by reductases under hypoxia to release cytotoxins, which in some instances may diffuse to kill surrounding oxic tumour tissue. A number of these hypoxia-activated prodrugs have been examined in clinical trial and the merits and shortcomings of recent examples are discussed. There has been an evolution from delivering DNA-interactive cytotoxins to molecularly targeted agents. Efforts to implement these strategies clinically continue today, but success has been elusive. Several issues have been identified that compromised these clinical campaigns. A failure to consider the extravascular transport and the micropharmacokinetic properties of the prodrugs has reduced efficacy. One key element for these 'targeted' approaches is the need to co-develop biomarkers to identify appropriate patients. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs require biomarkers for hypoxia, but also for appropriate activating reductases in tumours, as well as markers of intrinsic sensitivity to the released drug. The field is still evolving and changes in radiation delivery and the impact of immune-oncology will provide fertile ground for future innovation. (C) 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists.

AB Hypoxia affects alveolar homeostasis and may induce epithelial injury, which has been implicated in lung diseases such as fibrosis. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are, however, largely unknown. Primary rat alveolar epithelial type II cells (ATII) exposed to graded hypoxia for 24 and 48 h caused a dose-dependent induction of cell cycle arrest and suppression of proliferation, which were comparable to the effects of angiotensin II, a potent inducer of ATII cell death. Hypoxia-induced changes in ATII homeostasis are thought to proceed primarily via activation of hypoxia inducible-factor (HIF)-1 alpha, because hypoxia increased HIF-1 alpha protein expression, nuclear translocation, and transactivation of its specific DNA binding domain, the hypoxia responsive element (HRE). Under hypoxic conditions, expression of the proapoptotic protein Bnip3L, which belongs to the Bcl 2 family and is known to be one of the HIF-1-dependent target genes, was upregulated. Suppression of HIF-1 alpha or Bnip-3L with small interfering RNA (siRNA) fully blocked the hypoxia-induced apoptosis and Bnip3L expression. In line with these data, overexpression of HIF-1 alpha by transient transfection enhanced the hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Thus, we conclude that hypoxia suppresses alveolar epithelial cell proliferation and enhances ATII apoptosis through activation of the HIF-1 alpha/HRE axis and a mechanism that involves Bnip3L. Targeting HIF-1a may represent a new strategy that could impede the alveolar denudation that is observed in several lung diseases.

AB Low oxygen availability (hypoxia) is a prominent but poorly understood feature in multiple sclerosis (MS). Whether hypoxia causes or drives MS pathology and symptoms or whether it is a consequence of other pathological events, such as inflammation and vascular dysfunction, is unknown. Here, we summarize the available literature on the interplay between hypoxia and both pathological and symptomatic features of MS. Severe environmental hypoxia (i.e., altitude) may trigger or facilitate MS-related events, possibly by exacerbating tissue hypoxia in the central nervous system. Accordingly, increasing oxygen supply can mitigate pathological and clinical parameters in MS models. In contrast, stimulating the endogenous hypoxia response and adaptation systems by controlled exposure to hypoxia (hypoxia conditioning) renders the central nervous system more resistant to hypoxic insults, thereby attenuating pathology and symptomatology in MS models. Overlapping mechanisms likely play a role in the benefits conferred by physical activity in MS. We provide an integrative model to explain the paradoxically beneficial outcomes of both increased and decreased ambient oxygen conditions. In conclusion, controlled exposure to hypoxia, perhaps in combination with exercise, is a promising, possibly disease-course modifying therapeutic approach for MS. However, many open questions remain.

AB Objectives: Hypoxia is a common feature of extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells that promote invasion during the early stages of human placentation. This study aimed to examine whether hypoxia-induced an invasive phenotype in EVT cells in vitro and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Design: The invasiveness of primary EVT cells isolated from the first trimester placental tissues during weeks 5-8 of gestation was examined under hypoxic (5% O-2) and normoxic (20% O-2) conditions. Methods: Invasiveness was determined by transwell and wound-healing invasion assays using the IncuCyte ZOOM (TM) Live-Cell Imaging System. Protein expression of the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), uPA receptor (uPAR), and plasminogen activator inhibitor of hypoxia or normoxia-treated cells was measured using Western blot analysis. Knockdown of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) was assessed using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Results: Hypoxia enhanced EVT cell invasion but did not affect apoptosis. The stimulatory effect of hypoxia on EVT cell invasiveness was associated with induction of the uPA-uPAR pathway. The synthetic inhibitor of uPAR significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced EVT cell invasion. Silencing of HIF-1 alpha by siRNA abolished the stimulatory effect of hypoxia and inhibited the upregulation of uPAR expression, suggesting that the HIF-1 alpha-uPAR signal is the key mediator for hypoxia-induced EVT cell invasion. Further experiments need to be performed to elucidate the HIF-1 alpha-uPAR signal pathways. Conclusions: The low oxygen-regulated early events of EVT invasion may be mediated by the HIF-1 alpha-uPAR pathway. (C) 2022 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Prolonged hypoxia results in structural and functional adaptive responses to improve tissue oxygen delivery. Structural changes within the brain include vascular proliferation and elongation. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether ultrastructural changes in capillary walls also occur as part of the adaptive response. Adult rats were exposed to 2 or 3 weeks of moderate hypobaric hypoxia at 0.5 atmospheres and their cerebral microvasculature examined using quantitative ultrastructural methods. We found that hypoxic rats had an 18% increase in their brain capillary diameter but no change in endothelial wall thickness, basement membrane thickness, or coverage of the endothelial wall by pericytes. The increased diameter of cerebral capillaries may play an important role in decreasing the resistance to capillary perfusion which is brought about by the increased erythrocyte fraction in the blood of hypoxic rats. Ultrastructural features relevant to the blood-brain barrier were maintained in hypoxic rats. Pericytes, that are thought to form a second line of defense in the blood-brain barrier, maintained their numerical and size relationships to the endothelial cells. Endothelial junctions were unchanged and endothelial vesicles were somewhat lower in density than normal at 2 weeks of hypoxia, but had regained their normal density by 3 weeks. Mitochondria of the brain capillary endothelial cells maintained normal numerical and volume densities in hypoxia, but the mitochondria of the surrounding neuropil were decreased significantly by about 30%.

AB This review focuses on how measured pre- and perinatal environmental and (epi)genetic risk factors are interrelated and potentially influence one, of many, common developmental pathway towards ADHD. Consistent with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis, lower birth weight is associated with increased ADHD risk. Prenatal ischemia-hypoxia (insufficient blood and oxygen supply in utero) is a primary pathway to lower birth weight and produces neurodevelopmental risk for ADHD. To promote tissue survival in the context of ischemia-hypoxia, ischemia-hypoxia response (IHR) pathway gene expression is altered in the developing brain and peripheral tissues. Although altered IHR gene expression is adaptive in the context of ischemia-hypoxia, lasting IHR epigenetic modifications may lead to increased ADHD risk. Taken together, IHR genetic vulnerability to ischemia-hypoxia and IHR epigenetic alterations following prenatal ischemia-hypoxia may result in neurodevelopmental vulnerability for ADHD. Limitations of the extant literature and future directions for genetically-informed research are discussed.

AB Hypoxia and the androgen receptor (AR) play important roles in the development and progression of prostate cancer. In this study, the combined effects of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and hypoxia on AR-mediated transactivation were investigated. Hypoxia alone did not induce a detectable ARE-mediaced response in the absence of DHT. DHT-induced AR transcriptional activity was dramatically increased by hypoxia or ectopic expression of HIF-1 alpha, as determined by introducing ARE-responsive reporter plasmids into LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The secretion of VEGF was enhanced by the combination of hypoxia and DHT as compared to each treatment alone. These effects were not due to increased expression of the AR or HIF-1 alpha as a result of hypoxia and DHT treatment. These results provide evidence that hypoxia may stimulate as yet unknown factors, which further stimulate AR signal transduction pathways. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of mitochondrial activity on gene expression programs, particularly those involved in neuroprotection and repair, is likely to play an important role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. One such gene expression program is activated by the cellular pathway that senses a decrease in optimal oxygen levels and leads to activation of a family of transcriptional activators called hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). HIFs are members of the bHLH-PAS family of transcription factors and are heterodimers composed of HIF-alpha and HIF-beta (also known as aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) subunits that: bind to canonical DNA sequences (hypoxia-regulated elements) in the promoters or enhancers of target genes. HIFs activate the expression of more than a hundred genes encoding proteins that regulate cell metabolism, survival, angiogenesis, vascular tone, hematopoiesis, and other functions. There is considerable evidence showing a bidirectional crosstalk between mitochondrial signals and HIF activity. For instance, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and metabolic substrates from the tricarboxylic acid cycle are implicated in the regulation of the HIF pathway. Conversely; HIF activity leads to the expression of target genes that influence mitochondrial function. In this chapter we will review the complex interactions between mitochondria and the HIF pathway and we will discuss the relevance of this interaction for metabolic adaptation to hypoxia.

AB Ferroptosis is a new form of programmed cell death, which is characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxidation and increase of ROS, resulting in oxidative stress and cell death. Iron, lipid, and multiple signaling pathways precisely control the occurrence and implementation of ferroptosis. The pathways mainly include Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, p62/Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Activating p62/Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway inhibits ferroptosis. Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway promotes ferroptosis. Furthermore, some factors also participate in the occurrence of ferroptosis under hypoxia, such as HIF-1, NCOA4, DMT1. Meanwhile, ferroptosis is related with hypoxia-related diseases, such as MIRI, cancers, and AKI. Accordingly, ferroptosis appears to be a therapeutic target for hypoxia-related diseases.

AB Quercetin, a ubiquitous bioactive plant flavonoid, has been shown to inhibit. the proliferation of cancer cells and induce the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) in normoxia. In this study, under hypoxic conditions (1% O(2)), we examined the effect of quercetin on the intracellular level of HIF-1 alpha and extracellular level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a variety of human cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, we observed that quercetin suppressed the HIF-1 alpha accumulation during hypoxia in human prostate cancer LNCaP, colon cancer CX-1, and breast cancer SkBr3 cells. Quercetin treatment also significantly reduced hypoxia-induced secretion of VEGF. Suppression of HIF-1 alpha accumulation during treatment with quercetin in hypoxia was not prevented by treatment with 26S proteasome inhibitor MG132 or PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Interestingly, hypoxia (1% O(2)) in the presence of 100 mu M quercetin inhibited protein synthesis by 94% during incubation for 8 h. Significant quercetin concentration-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis and suppression of HIF-1 alpha accumulation were observed under hypoxic conditions. Treatment with 100 mu M cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, replicated the effect of quercetin by inhibiting HIF-1 alpha accumulation during hypoxia. These results suggest that suppression of HIF-1 alpha accumulation during treatment with quercetin under hypoxic conditions is due to inhibition of protein synthesis.

AB Purpose of review Angiogenesis is a prominent feature of rheumatoid synovitis, Although new blood vessels deliver oxygen to the augmented inflammatory cell mass, the neovascular network is dysfunctional and fails to restore tissue oxygen homeostasis, so that the rheumatoid joint remains a markedly hypoxic environment. The purpose of this review is to discuss the role of hypoxia and angiogenesis in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.
   Recent findings Vascular pathologic change, in the form of angiogenesis, is important in the perpetuation of rheumatoid arthritis and, in the form of endothelial dysfunction, contributes to associated cardiovascular comorbidity. Recent data suggest that tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockade may modify the vascular pathologic changes in rheumatoid arthritis. Angiogenesis is a prominent feature of rheumatoid synovitis. Emerging evidence based on ultrasonographic vascular imaging and angiogenic biomarkers implicates angiogenesis in the active phase of erosive disease. Many factors contribute to the profoundly hypoxic environment that can arise within the joint affected by rheumatoid arthritis. At a cellular level, hypoxia is detected by a mechanism that regulates cytoplasmic concentrations of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha. After translocation to the nucleus, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha binds its partner hypoxia-inducible factor-1 beta to form a heterodimeric, functional transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1, which activates a gene program associated with angiogenesis, glycolysis, and adaptation to pH.
   Summary Despite the luxuriant vasculature associated with rheumatoid arthritis synovitis, the joint affected by rheumatoid arthritis is hypoxic. Repetitive cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation together with oxidants produced by phagocytic cells promote chronic oxidative stress within the microenvironment of the affected joint, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species with the potential to contribute to tissue damage.

AB To investigate the effects of diel-cycling hypoxia acclimation on the hypoxia tolerance, swimming and growth performance of juvenile southern catfish, we initially measured the critical oxygen tension (P-crit), oxygen thresholds of aquatic surface respiration (ASR) and loss of equilibrium (LOE) of diel-cycling hypoxia-acclimated (15 d, 7:00-21:00, dissolved oxygen level (DO) = 7.0 +/- 0.2 mg L-1; 21:00-7:00, DO = 3.0 +/- 0.2 mg L-1) and non-acclimated (15 d, DO = 7.0 +/- 0.2 mg L-1) southern catfish at 25 degrees C. We then measured the critical swimming speed (U-crit) and metabolic rate (MR) of hypoxia-acclimated and non-acclimated fish (under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions). The feeding rate (FR), feeding efficiency (FE) and specific growth rate (SGR) of fish in hypoxia-acclimated and non-acclimated groups were also measured. The P-crit, ASR and LOE of hypoxia-acclimated fish were significantly lower than those of non-acclimated fish. Hypoxia acclimation resulted in a significantly higher U-crit when the individuals swam in hypoxia. The U-crit, maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and metabolic scope (MS) of both the hypoxia-acclimated and non-acclimated fish all decreased with the decrease of DO. However, the U-crit, MMR and MS decreased by 31, 43 and 54%, respectively, in non-acclimated fish, whereas these values decreased by 15, 28 and 29%, respectively, in hypoxia-acclimated fish, which suggests that hypoxia-acclimated fish were less sensitive to the DO decrease. The FR, FE and SGR all decreased by 21, 20 and 45%, respectively, in the hypoxia-acclimated group compared to the non-acclimated group. This result suggests that diel-cycling hypoxia acclimation improved the hypoxia tolerance and aerobic swimming performance of southern catfish, whereas impaired the growth performance. The high hypoxia tolerance and physiological plasticity to hypoxia-acclimated southern catfish may be related to its lower maintenance energy expenditure, sit-and-wait lifestyle and bottom-dwelling living environment condition (usually facing oxygen fluctuation). The growth performance of so-called 'visceral type' fish species, such as southern catfish, are more sensitive to hypoxia compared to other fish species because of their high peak post-prandial metabolic rate, which may be restrained by the limited aerobic metabolic scope in hypoxia.

AB Hypoxia, the phenomenon of decline of oxygen levels in tissues, is a key feature of many diseases and exacerbates the progression of some. At the same time, prolonged hypoxia can cause mitochondrial autophagy and promote viscosity. Therefore, fluorescent probes for detecting hypoxia have been widely reported. However, most of the fluorescence probes used for hypoxia detection have low signal amplification. Therefore, we developed a novel fluorescence probe NF that is co-regulated by hypoxia and viscosity. The probe is capable of rapid response (100 s) with hypoxia marker nitroreductase (NTR) and is capable of signal amplification after viscosity response. Moreover, NF was the first to detect hypoxia in early alcoholic liver injury mice (predate histopathological analysis) and hypoxia in early rheumatoid arthritis.

AB AimTraffic between the plasma membrane and the endomembrane compartments is an essential feature of eukaryotic cells. The secretory pathway sends cargoes from biosynthetic compartments to the plasma membrane. This is counterbalanced by a retrograde endocytic route and is essential for cell homoeostasis. Cells need to adapt rapidly to environmental challenges such as the reduction of pO(2) which, however, has not been analysed in relation to membrane trafficking in detail. Therefore, we determined changes in the plasma membrane trafficking in normoxia, hypoxia, and after reoxygenation.
   MethodsMembrane trafficking was analysed by using the bulk membrane endocytosis marker FM 1-43, the newly developed membrane probe mCLING, wheat germ agglutinin as well as fluorescently labelled cholera toxin subunit B. Additionally, the uptake of specific membrane proteins was determined. In parallel, a non-biased SILAC screen was performed to analyse the abundance of membrane proteins in normoxia and hypoxia.
   ResultsMembrane trafficking was increased in hypoxia and quickly reversed upon reoxygenation. This effect was independent of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) system. Using SILAC technology, we identified that the actin-bundling protein T-plastin is recruited to the plasma membrane in hypoxia. By the use of T-plastin knockdown cells, we could show that T-plastin mediates the hypoxia-induced membrane trafficking, which was associated with an increased actin density in the cells as determined by electron microscopy.
   ConclusionMembrane trafficking is highly dynamic upon hypoxia. This phenotype is quickly reversible upon reoxygenation, which suggests that this mechanism participates in the cellular adaptation to hypoxia.

AB INTRODUCTION: Hypoxia training is mandatory for military pilots, but variability in hypoxia symptoms challenges the training. In a previous study we showed that 64% of pilots recognized hypoxia faster in their second normobaric hypoxia session conducted 2.4yr after the first. Our aim here was to evaluate whether a third session conducted 5.0yr after the first would provide further benefit. METHODS: This study was conducted under normobaric conditions in a tactical F/A-18C Hornet simulator in three sessions in which the pilots performed visual identification missions and breathed 21% oxygen in nitrogen. The breathing gas was changed to a hypoxic mixture containing either 8%, 7%, or6%oxygen in nitrogen without the pilot's knowledge. Data were collected from 102 military pilots. The primary outcome was the time taken for initial identification of hypoxia symptoms. RESULTS: Hypoxia symptoms were recognized on average in the first session in 8% oxygen in 100 s, 7% oxygen in 90 s, and 6% oxygen in 78 s; in the second in 87 s, 80 s, and 71 s, respectively; and in the third in 79 s, 67 s, and 64 s, respectively. In 2 sessions 20 pilots and in each 3 training sessions 3 pilots had slow recognition times. DISCUSSION: Hypoxia symptom recognition improved the further the repeated normobaric hypoxia training went. More emphasis should be put on the 23% group of slow hypoxia symptom recognizers and more customized hypoxia training for them should be offered.

AB Tumor hypoxia correlates with resistance to chemotherapy, increased incidence of metastasis and poor clinical prognosis. Early breast cancer lesions such as carcinoma in situ, characterized by filled lumens, are often associated with hypoxic markers. However, the contribution of hypoxia to changes in tissue architecture in early pre-malignant lesions is not well defined. Using three dimensional basement membrane cultures of mammary epithelial cells, we recently reported that acini-like structures exposed to hypoxia display epithelial disorganization and delayed lumen formation. We found that hypoxia, via HIF-1a, targets signaling pathways, specifically the Erk-Bim axis, to suppress anoikis-cell death in a 3D acinar model. Here, we discuss these findings further and present additional data, indicating that hypoxia-mediated alterations in acinar architecture and anoikis-associated Erk-Bim signaling are maintained in mammary epithelial cells after reoxygenation. Taken together, these findings may offer new insight into the contribution of hypoxia-mediated signaling in the progression of early breast cancer lesions and possible treatment of hypoxic cancers.

AB Hypoxia is an important microenvironmental factor that induces cancer metastasis. Hypoxia/hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) regulates many important steps of the metastatic processes, especially epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is one of the crucial mechanisms to cause early stage of tumor metastasis. To have a better understanding of the mechanism of hypoxia-regulated metastasis, various hypoxia/HIF-1 alpha-regulated target genes are categorized into different classes including transcription factors, histone modifiers, enzymes, receptors, kinases, small GTPases, transporters, adhesion molecules, surface molecules, membrane proteins, and microRNAs. Different roles of these target genes are described with regards to their relationship to hypoxia-induced metastasis. We hope that this review will provide a framework for further exploration of hypoxia/HIF-1 alpha-regulated target genes and a comprehensive view of the metastatic picture induced by hypoxia.

AB Background and aim: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious and even fatal disorder with limited treatment strategies. The hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (HPH) rat model is commonly used in this field. While the HPH rat model has strong predictability and repeatability, the model is a chronic model, making it time-consuming, costly, and complicated and limiting the progress of the experiments. Currently, there is no uniform international standard for the HPH model. Our study aimed to find a relatively effective and efficient HPH modeling protocol. Methods: We established HPH rat models with different total hypoxia periods and different daily hypoxia times, and assessed different hypoxia modeling modes in multiple dimensions, such as haemodynamics, right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, pulmonary arterial remodeling, muscularization, inflammation, and collagen deposition. Results: Longer daily hypoxia time resulted in higher mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP)/right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and more obvious RV hypertrophy, as well as more severe pulmonary arterial remodeling and muscularization, regardless of the total period of hypoxia (3- or 4-week). Moreover, pulmonary perivascular macrophages and collagen deposition showed daily hypoxia time-dependent increases, both in 3- and 4-week hypoxia groups. Conclusion: Our findings showed that the 3-week continuous hypoxia mode was a relatively efficient way to reduce the time needed to induce significant disease phenotypes, which offered methodological evidence for future studies in building HPH models.

AB Hypoxia, defined as a decrease of tissue oxygen levels, represents a fundamental pathophysiological condition in the microenvironment of solid tumors. Tumor hypoxia is known to be associated with radio/chemo-resistance and metastasis that eventually lead to cancer progression contributing to poor prognosis in cancer patients. Among transcription factors that accumulated under hypoxic conditions, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a master transcription factor that has received the most intense attention in this field of research due to its capacity to modulate several hundred genes. With a clearer understanding of the HIF-1 pathway, efforts are directed at manipulation of this complex genetic process in order to ultimately decrease cellular HIF-1 levels. Some novel agents have been shown to have HIF-1 inhibition activity through a variety of molecular mechanisms and have provided promising results in the preclinical setting.

AB BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to quantify the efficacy of using exercise to alleviate the impairments in mood state associated with hypoxic exposure.
   METHODS: Nineteen young, healthy men completed Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics-4th Edition (ANAM4) versions of the mood state test before hypoxia exposure, after 60 min of hypoxia exposure (12.5% O-2), and during and after two intensities of cycling exercise (40% and 60% adjusted (V)over dot o(2max)) under the same hypoxic conditions. Peripheral oxygen saturation (Sp02) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSo(2)) were continuously monitored.
   RESULTS: At rest in hypoxia,Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) was significantly increased compared to baseline in both the 40% and 60% groups. TMD was significantly decreased during exercise compared to rest in hypoxia.TMD was also significantly decreased during recovery compared to rest in hypoxia. Spo(2) significantly decreased at 60 min rest in hypoxia, during exercise, and recovery compared to baseline. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation was also reduced at 60 min rest in hypoxia, during exercise, and recovery compared to baseline.
   DISCUSSION: The current study demonstrated that exercise at 40% and 60% of adjusted (V)over dot o(2max) attenuated the adverse effects of hypoxia on mood. These findings may have significant applied value, as negative mood states are known to impair performance in hypoxia. Further studies are needed to replicate the current finding and to clarify the possible mechanisms associated with the potential benefits of exercise on mood state in normobaric hypoxia.

ID FREQUENCY; IMPACTS; EVENTS
AB Marine heatwaves are extreme oceanic events that can have severe impacts on ecosystems and economies. Recent studies have suggested future increases in the severity and duration of these events. However, these findings are based on coarse resolution climate models that cannot resolve important ocean structures. This study uses a 0.25 degrees coupled regional model to quantify how marine heatwaves around Australia respond under a high emissions scenario. We find that increases to future marine heatwave statistics are primarily caused by changes in the mean temperature, with changes in variability important in some areas. Temperature variance changes are most prominent close to Tasmania, with a covariance temperature budget demonstrating that this is linked to large simulated increases in East Australian Current transport and variability. Close to New Zealand, changes in surface heat fluxes also play an important role. These results quantify the response of marine heatwave characteristics to future temperature changes.

AB The hypoxia signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved cellular signaling pathway present in animals ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals. The pathway is crucial for oxygen homeostasis maintenance. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha) are master regulators in the hypoxia signaling pathway. Oxygen concentrations vary a lot in the aquatic environment. To deal with this, fishes have adapted and developed varying strategies for living in hypoxic conditions. Investigations into the strategies and mechanisms of hypoxia adaptation in fishes will allow us to understand fish speciation and breed hypoxia-tolerant fish species/strains. This review summarizes the process of the hypoxia signaling pathway and its regulation, as well as the mechanism of hypoxia adaptation in fishes.

AB Aim of the study was to explore the influence of hypoxia on multidrug resistance related genes and the potential role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha (HIF-1 alpha) in formation of multidrug resistance in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. HepG2 cells were subjected to hypoxia in a cohort of exposed time. A cell model stably expressing HIF-1 alpha was established by liposome-mediated transfection of plasmid pcDNA3/HIF-1 alpha, into HepG2 cells. Apoptosis of HepG2 cells exposed to hypoxia or transfected by plasmid pcDNA3/HIF-1 alpha was detected by Flow Cytometry after administration of chemotherapeutic drug (5-Fu). Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR and Western-blot technique were used to analyze the expressions of multidrug resistance related genes mdr1, MRP1 and LRP at mRNA and protein level, respectively. Apoptosis Index of HepG2 cells exposed to hypoxia stepped down as exposed time extended after administration of 5-Fu. The expression of mdr1, MRP1 and LRP gene and protein revealed a hypoxic time-dependent induction and was synchronous with the alterations of HIF-1 alpha in HepG2 cells exposed to hypoxia. The expressions of these multidrug resistance related genes were remarkably increased in HIF-1 alpha transfected HepG2 cells as compared to empty vector transfected cells. Apoptosis index of HIF-1 alpha transfected cells was obviously less than that of control cells when they were simultaneously exposed to 5-Fu for 24hrs. In conclusion, ambient hypoxia might be one of the causes for the formation of multidrug resistance in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. Hypoxia-elicited multidrug resistance related protein expression might be a pathway for resistance of HepG2 cells to chemotherapeutics and HIF-1 alpha might be involved in this process.

AB The cytotoxicity of the disulfide n-butyl 2-imidazolyl disulfide (III-2) was determined to be the result of a disruption in the cellular redox state and inhibition of critical membrane enzymes. These events cause perturbations in Ca2+ homeostasis, which may affect the cell signalling machinery and cause the activation of catabolic enzymes. Exposure of EMT6 cells to III-2 resulted in depletion of nonprotein and protein thiols. Under hypoxic conditions, the depletion of reduced glutathione was less than that measured when cells were treated in air, whereas following an exposure to 500 mu M III-2 for 2 h the enzymes glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase were inhibited to a greater extent under hypoxia. Ca2+ homeostasis was disrupted with an initial shift from the mitochondrial to the cytoplasmic pool. The inhibition of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase resulted in accumulation of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm. At higher concentrations, further disruption was seen as a net loss of Ca2+ of the cytoplasmic excess with no change in the mitochondrial levels, resulting in lower total cellular Ca2+. Neither the inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase nor the disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis were different under hypoxic vs. oxic conditions. Due to these observations, HL60 cells were used to measure whether III-2 stimulated apoptosis. Morphologic changes and DNA laddering were observed following exposure to the disulfide, with lower concentrations required to stimulate the cellular changes under hypoxia. These events may be the result of the disruption in Ca2+ homeostasis due to thiolation or alteration in redox status of the cells. Based on the present findings along with previous reports of enzyme inhibition and limited NADPH generation under hypoxia, it has been concluded that hypoxia makes the cells less able to cope with the oxidative stress caused by III-2. As a consequence, cells under these conditions are more susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of III-2.

AB We observed recently1 that placental leptin is markedly increased in preeclampsia. Since this disorder is associated with vascular disorders, we have tested the hypothesis that hypoxia regulates leptin expression. We show that hypoxia increased leptin mRNA and secretion in trophoblast-derived BeWo cells. This effect was mediated through leptin promoter activation. 5' deletion analysis allowed us to delineate two regions containing 1.87 kb and 1.20 kb of the promoter which conferred respectively high and low responsiveness to hypoxia. These data indicate that leptin is up-regulated by hypoxia through a transcriptional mechanism likely to involve distinct hypoxia-responsive cis-acting sequences on the promoter.

AB Hypoxia plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) and presumably also chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is the master transcription factor that regulates adaptive responses against hypoxia. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF activates target genes with hypoxia-responsive elements in their regulatory regions. The HIF isoforms and regulators of HIF (i.e. prolyl hydroxylases) show cell type-specific distributions. Hypoxia is observed in both ischaemic and so-called non-ischaemic forms of AKI. In addition to the acute phase, hypoxia may ensue during the recovery phase of AKI, possibly due to the oxygen-consuming processes of cell growth and proliferation for repair. Although HIF protects the kidney against AKI, intrinsic HIF activation is submaximal in AKI and further augmentation of HIF ameliorates disease manifestations. The kidney in CKD also suffers from hypoxia caused by multiple mechanisms, including sustained oxygen demands in the remaining nephrons due to maladaptive tubuloglomerular feedback. Whether HIF is chronically upregulated in CKD is contentious. Hypoxia-inducible factor activation is a promising therapeutic approach to CKD, but excessive activation of HIF may be deleterious. It is likely that there is a therapeutic window of HIF activation in chronic conditions. Under certain circumstances, animals with CKD are protected against AKI and this may be explained by non-physiological hypoxia of the kidney and subsequent HIF expression. In addition, an acute hypoxic insult may induce long-lasting changes, possibly including epigenetic modifications induced by HIF. These observations suggest a complex interaction between AKI and CKD via hypoxia and HIF activation.

AB Recently, the research on stemness and multilineage differentiation mechanisms has greatly increased its value due to the potential therapeutic impact of stem cell-based approaches. Stem cells modulate their self-renewing and differentiation capacities in response to endogenous and/or extrinsic factors that can control stem cell fate. One key factor controlling stem cell phenotype is oxygen (O-2). Several pieces of evidence demonstrated that the complexity of reproducing O-2 physiological tensions and gradients in culture is responsible for defective stem cell behavior in vitro and after transplantation. This evidence is still worsened by considering that stem cells are conventionally incubated under non-physiological air O-2 tension (21%). Therefore, the study of mechanisms and signaling activated at lower O-2 tension, such as those existing under native microenvironments (referred to as hypoxia), represent an effective strategy to define if O-2 is essential in preserving naive stemness potential as well as in modulating their differentiation. Starting from this premise, the goal of the present review is to report the status of the art about the link existing between hypoxia and stemness providing insight into the factors/molecules involved, to design targeted strategies that, recapitulating naive O-2 signals, enable towards the therapeutic use of stem cell for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

AB Hypoxia is a common characteristic of many solid tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. Cells with low oxygen levels can have altered sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy secondary to changes in the incidence of DNA single- and double-strand breaks (DNA-ssb, DNA-dsb), DNA base damage, DNA-DNA cross-links and DNA-protein cross-links. Recent evidence also supports that cells exposed to chronic hypoxia have a decreased capacity of DNA-dsb repair. This review will examine the influence of short-term and prolonged hypoxia on the two major pathways of DNA-dsb repair: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Novel treatment strategies designed to exploit the hypoxic tumor microenvironment are also discussed. Modification of DNA damage sensing and repair due to fluctuating oxygen levels within a dynamic tumor microenvironment may have profound implications for tumor progression and treatment.

AB Metastasis to bone, liver and lungs is the primary cause of death in breast cancer patients. Our studies have revealed that the novel tumor suppressor Pdcd4 inhibits breast cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro. Loss of Pdcd4 in human nonmetastatic breast cancer cells increased the expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) mRNA. LOX is a hypoxia-inducible amine oxidase, the activity of which enhances breast cancer cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. Specific inhibition of LOX activity by beta-aminopropionitrile or small interfering RNA decreased the invasiveness of T47D and MCF7 breast cancer cells attenuated for Pdcd4 function. Most significantly, loss of Pdcd4 augments hypoxia induction of LOX as well. Conversely, overexpression of Pdcd4 significantly reversed the hypoxia induction of LOX expression in T47D cells attenuated for Pdcd4. However, Pdcd4 did not affect hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) protein expression or HIF-1-responsive element-luciferase activity in response to hypoxia, suggesting that Pdcd4 regulation of LOX occurs through an HIF-independent mechanism. Nevertheless, the loss of Pdcd4 early in cancer progression may have an important role in the increased sensitivity of cancer cells to hypoxia through increased LOX activity and concomitant enhanced invasiveness.

AB 1. The influence of local hypoxia on adenosine and lactate output from isolated perfused gracilis muscle was studied in anaesthetized dogs.
   2. Oxygen tension in the arterial blood supplying the muscle was reduced by a membrane lung from 145.9+/-28.9 to 52.9+/-2.6 (moderate hypoxia) or 30.0+/-1.2 mmHg (severe hypoxia).
   3. Moderate hypoxia did not significantly alter vascular resistance, but severe hypoxia reduced arterial perfusion pressure from 199.0+/-13.6 to 122.6+/-8.7 mmHg.
   4. Veno-arterial (V-A) lactate was 0.47+/-0.13 mmol/L in normoxia; neither level of hypoxia changed it significantly. Veno-arterial adenosine was 74+/-78 nmol/L in normoxia. Moderate hypoxia decreased this to -36+/-59 nmol/L (P<0.05), but the level of V-A adenosine in severe hypoxia (52+/-96 nmol/L) was similar to that in normoxia.
   5. These data confirm that hypoxia does not directly stimulate adenosine output from oxidative skeletal muscle.

AB w Tumor hypoxia correlates to aggressive disease, and while this is explained by a variety of factors, one clue to understand this phenomena was the finding that hypoxia induces a de-differentiated, stem cell-like phenotype in neuroblastoma and breast tumor cells. The hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFs) are regulated at the translational level by fluctuating oxygen concentrations, but emerging data reveal that both HIF-la and HIF-2 alpha expression can be induced by aberrantly activated growth factor signaling independently of oxygen levels. Furthermore, HIF-2 alpha is regulated by hypoxia also at the transcriptional level in neuroblastoma and glioma cells. In cultured tumor cells, HIF-2 alpha is stabilized at physiological oxygen concentrations followed by induced expression of classical hypoxia-driven genes, resulting in a pseudohypoxic phenotype. In addition, in neuroblastoma and glioma specimens, a small subset of HIF-2 alpha positive, HIF-la negative, tumor cells is found adjacent to blood vessels, i.e. in areas with presumably adequate oxygenation. These tumor niches are thus pseudohypoxic, and the HIF-2 alpha expressing cells present immature features. We have postulated that this niche in neuroblastomas encompass the tumor stem cells. Oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes associated with pseudohypoxia are frequently mutated or deleted in the germline, implicating that the pseudohypoxic phenotype indeed is tumorigenic. In summary, the hypoxic and pseudohypoxic phenotypes of solid tumors are attractive therapeutic targets.

AB Endothelin (ET) is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide of endothelial cell origin. Recent studies have suggested a nonvascular paracrine and/or autocrine role for endothelin in the kidney. This study was designed to elucidate the renal ET response to acute moderate hypoxia, as reflected by urinary ET excretory rate and renal tissue ET immunoreactivity, and to correlate these responses to the hemodynamic and excretory changes during hypoxia. Experiments were conducted in two groups of anesthetized dogs: hypoxic group (10% O2 ventilation: PO2, 44 mm Hg; N = 7) and time control group (room air ventilation: P(O2), 111 mm Hg; N = 6). After 60 min of hypoxia or room air ventilation, kidneys were harvested and stained immunohistochemically for ET. Acute moderate hypoxia was associated with significant increases in urinary ET excretion, urine flow, urinary sodium excretion, and fractional excretion of sodium (P < 0.05). There was no significant change in GFR, RBF, renal vascular resistance, or mean arterial pressure. Renal immunohistochemistry for ET revealed increased staining in the proximal and distal tubules in the hypoxic group as compared with controls. This study demonstrates that acute moderate hypoxia results in increased urinary ET excretion and renal tubular ET immunoreactivity, in association with diuresis and natriuresis, and suggests a nonvascular role of endogenously produced renal ET in the regulation of sodium homeostasis during hypoxia.

AB Metastasis is responsible for more than 90 % of deaths among cancer patient. It is a highly complex process that involves the interplay between cancer cells, the tumor microenvironment, and even noncancerous host cells. Metastasis can be seen as a step-wise process: acquisition of malignant phenotype, invasion into surrounding tissue, intravasation into blood vessels, survival in circulation, extravasation to distant sites, and colonization of new organs. Before the actual metastatic process, the secondary site is also prepared for the arrival of the cancer cells through formation of "premetastatic niches." Hypoxia (low oxygen tension) is commonly found in solid tumors more than a few millimeters cubed and often is associated with a poor prognosis. Hypoxia increases angiogenesis, cancer cell survival, and metastasis. This chapter described how hypoxia regulates each step of the metastatic process and how blocking hypoxia-driven metastasis through targeting hypoxia-inducible factor 1, or downstream effector molecules such as the lysyl oxidase family may represent highly effective preventive strategies against metastasis in cancer patients.

AB HIF1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha) is considered a central oxygen-threshold sensor in mammalian cells. In the presence of oxygen, HIF1 is marked by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) at the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain for ubiquitination followed by rapid proteasomal degradation. However, the actual mechanisms of oxygen sensing by HIF1 are still controversial. Thus, HIF1 expression correlates poorly with tissue oxygen levels, and PHDs are themselves target genes of HIF1 considered to readjust to new oxygen thresholds. In contrast to hypoxia chambers, we here establish an enzymatic model that allows both the rapid induction of stable hypoxia and independent control of H2O2. Rapid enzymatic hypoxia only transiently induced HIF1 in various cell types and the HIF1 was completely degraded within 8-12 h despite Sustained hypoxia. HIF1 degradation under sustained hypoxia could be blocked by a competitive ODD-GFP construct and PHD siRNA, but also by cobalt chloride and micromolar H2O2 levels. Concomitant induction of PHDs further confirmed their role in degrading HIF1 under enzymatic hypoxia. The rapid and complete degradation of HIF1 under enzymatic hypoxia suggests that, in addition to hypoxia sensing, the HIF1/PHD loop may rather compensate for fluctuations of tissue oxygen staying tuned to other, e.g., metabolic, signals. In addition to hypoxia chambers, enzymatic hypoxia provides a valuable tool for independently studying the regulatory functions of hypoxia and oxidative stress in vitro. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Emerging evidence highlights moderate hypoxia as a candidate treatment for brain disorders. This systematic review examines findings and the methodological quality of studies investigating hypoxia (10-16% O2) for >= 14 days in humans, as well as the neurobiological mechanisms triggered by hypoxia in animals, and suggests optimal treatment protocols to guide future studies. We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) 2020. Searches were performed on PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, in May-September 2023. Two authors independently reviewed the human studies with the following tools: (1) revised Cochrane collaboration's risk of bias for randomized trials 2.0; (2) the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions. We identified 58 eligible studies (k = 8 human studies with N = 274 individuals; k = 48 animal studies) reporting the effects of hypoxia on cognition, motor function, neuroimaging, neuronal/synaptic morphology, inflammation, oxidative stress, erythropoietin, neurotrophins, and Alzheimer's disease markers. A total of 75% of human studies indicated cognitive and/or neurological benefits, although all studies were evaluated ashigh risk of bias due to a lack of randomization and assessor blinding. Low-dose intermittent or continuous hypoxia repeated for 30-240 min sessions, preferably in combination with motor-cognitive training, produced beneficial effects, and high-dose hypoxia with longer (>= 6 h) durations and chronic exposure produced more adverse effects. Larger and methodologically stronger translational studies are warranted.

AB Hypoxia is an environmental stressor that is instigated by low oxygen availability. It fuels the progression of solid tumors by driving tumor plasticity, heterogeneity, stemness and genomic instability. Hypoxia metabolically reprograms the tumor microenvironment (TME), adding insult to injury to the acidic, nutrient deprived and poorly vascularized conditions that act to dampen immune cell function. Through its impact on key cancer hallmarks and by creating a physical barrier conducive to tumor survival, hypoxia modulates tumor cell escape from the mounted immune response. The tumor cell-immune cell crosstalk in the context of a hypoxic TME tips the balance towards a cold and immunosuppressed microenvironment that is resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Nonetheless, evidence is emerging that could make hypoxia an asset for improving response to ICI. Tackling the tumor immune contexture has taken on an in silico, digitalized approach with an increasing number of studies applying bioinformatics to deconvolute the cellular and non-cellular elements of the TME. Such approaches have additionally been combined with signature-based proxies of hypoxia to further dissect the turbulent hypoxia-immune relationship. In this review we will be highlighting the mechanisms by which hypoxia impacts immune cell functions and how that could translate to predicting response to immunotherapy in an era of machine learning and computational biology.

AB Purpose: To detect and quantify hypoxia in colorectal adenocarcinomas by use of pimonidazole and iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) as extrinsic markers and carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), microvessel density (MVD), epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as intrinsic markers of hypoxia.
   Methods and Material: Twenty patients with an adenocarcinoma of the left colon and rectum treated by primary surgery were injected with pimonidazole and IdUrd. Serial sections of tumor biopsies were single stained for VEGF, EGFR, Ki67, and double stained for blood vessels in combination with either pimonidazole, IdUrd, or CA IX. Percentage of expression was scored as well as colocalization of pimonidazole with CA IX.
   Results: The median percentage of hypoxia, as judged by pimonidazole staining, was 16.7% (range, 0-52.4%). The expression of pimonidazole correlated inversely with the total MVD and endothelial cord MVD (R = -0.55, p = 0.01; R = -0.47, p = 0.04). Good colocalization was found between pimonidazole and CA IX in only 30% of tumors, with no correlation overall between pimonidazole and CA IX, VEGF, or EGFR or between the different intrinsic markers. Cells around some vessels (0.08 - 11%) were negative for IdUrd but positive for Ki67, which indicated their lack of perfusion at the time of injection.
   Conclusion: Chronic and acute hypoxic regions are present in colorectal tumors, as shown by pimonidazole and IdUrd staining. Only in a minority of tumors did an association exist between the areas stained by pimonidazole and those positive for CA IX. Pimonidazole also did not correlate with expression of other putative intrinsic hypoxia markers (VEGF, EGFR). (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Renal hypoxia is emerging as a key player in the pathophysiology of the AKI-toCKD transition. Capillary rarefaction after AKI episodes induces renal hypoxia, which can in turn profoundly affect tubular epithelial cells, (myo) fibroblasts, and inflammatory cells, culminating in tubulointerstitial fibrosis, i. e., progression to CKD. Damaged tubular epithelial cells that fail to redifferentiate might supply a decreased amount of vascular endothelial growth factor and contribute to capillary rarefaction, thus aggravating hypoxia and forming a vicious cycle. Mounting evidence also shows that epigenetic changes are closely related to renal hypoxia in the pathophysiology of CKD progression. Animal experiments suggest that targeting hypoxia is a promising strategy to block the transition from AKI to CKD. However, the precise mechanisms by which hypoxia induces the AKI-toCKD transition and by which hypoxia-inducible factor activation can exert a protective effect in this context should be clarified in further studies.

AB Work by Maria Rosa Miracle's group in 1989 described the adaptation of natural Brachionus plicatilis populations to low oxygen in oxyclines of meromictic lakes. This adaptation was accomplished by slowing metabolism in hypoxia, altering reproductive schedules and extending generation times. Many years later, Miracle's work inspired us to examine whether hypoxia could extend rotifer longevity and reproduction in our study of the biology of aging. In this paper we show that exposure of rotifers to four days of an atmosphere of 1.6 % O-2 extended mean lifespan 107 % over controls in normoxia (20.9 % O-2), whose mean lifespan was 7.9 days. Alternating days of hypoxia and normoxia also markedly extended rotifer lifespan by 53 %. Exposure to 1.6 % O2 hypoxia nearly doubled lifetime reproduction of females (24.3 vs 12.4 offspring in control). Hypoxia exposure protected rotifers from subsequent oxidative and UV stress, but not starvation, osmotic or heat stress. The 0-4 day age-classes responded best to hypoxia exposure as compared to hypoxia exposure days 4-8 or 8-12. The protective effects of two days of hypoxia exposure persisted through day 6, then vanished by day 8. Rotifer diapausing eggs are especially resistant to hypoxia and hatch in atmospheres containing as little as 1.6 % O-2 after a one day delay. Our conclusion is that exposure to hypoxia for four days in the youngest age classes extends rotifer longevity and enhances lifetime reproduction. This response has adaptive value in anoxic sediments where most rotifer diapausing eggs are deposited.

AB Hypoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation are known to affect vascular smooth muscle cell physiology. In this study, we first investigated proteoglycan synthesis by human aortic smooth muscle cells exposed to normoxia, hypoxia, or hypoxia/reoxygenation. We then compared the newly synthesized proteoglycans from normoxic and hypoxic-reoxygenation cultures for their ability to bind low density lipoprotein (LDL). Confluent smooth muscle cells under normoxia, hypoxia, or hypoxia/reoxygenation were pulsed with [S-35]sulfate, and secreted and cell-associated proteoglycans were analyzed. Secreted proteoglycans in cultures exposed to hypoxia (4 h)/reoxygenation (19 h) increased 28% over those of cells continuously exposed to normoxia. Cell-associated proteoglycans did not differ significantly between the two groups. In contrast, hypoxia (4 h) followed by a 30-min reoxygenation produced a 37% decrease in newly synthesized proteoglycans. Hypoxia alone also resulted in a 24% decrease in secreted proteoglycans and a 20% decrease in cell-associated proteoglycans. Proteoglycans newly synthesized by smooth muscle cells exposed to normoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation did not differ in their charge densities and molecular size but did differ in glycosaminoglycan composition. Exposure of smooth muscle cells to hypoxia/reoxygenation produced a 60% increase in a proteoglycan subfraction that bound LDL with very high affinity. The incorporation of [H-3]leucine into total cellular protein decreased significantly following exposure of smooth muscle cells to hypoxia as well as hypoxia/reoxygenation. These results indicate that hypoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation cause major alterations in proteoglycan metabolism by vascular smooth muscle cells. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Background/Objectives: In the tumor microenvironment, hypoxia regulates genes that support tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis under the control of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a secreted protein that activates cell migration in endothelial and cancer cells that express alpha nu beta 3 integrin but has inhibitory effects in cells that do not express alpha nu beta 3 integrin. In both cases, the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor zeta 1 (PTPRZ1) seems to mediate the effects of PTN. In the present work, we studied the effect of hypoxia on PTN and PTPRZ1 expression and the functional consequences of this effect. Methods: Western blot, quantitative real-time PCR, and luciferase assays were used to study the impact of hypoxia at the protein, mRNA, and transcriptional levels, respectively. Decoy oligonucleotides (ODNs), siRNA technology, and plasmid overexpression were used to study the involvement of the transcription factors studied. Functional assays were used to study the effect of hypoxia on cell proliferation and migration. Results: Hypoxia increases PTN expression through the transcriptional activation of the corresponding gene in alpha nu beta 3 integrin-expressing cells. The transcription factors HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha, and AP-1 mediate the up-regulation of PTN by hypoxia. Functional assays in endothelial cells from PTN knockout mice or endothelial and cancer cells following the downregulation of PTN expression showed that PTN negatively affects chemical hypoxia-induced cell proliferation and migration. In cancer cells that do not express alpha nu beta 3 integrin, hypoxia or chemical hypoxia inhibits PTN expression in a HIF-1 alpha-, HIF-2 alpha-, and AP-1-independent manner. The expression of PTPRZ1 is up-regulated by chemical hypoxia, is HIF-1 alpha- and HIF-2 alpha-dependent, and seems to limit the activation of HIF-1 alpha, at least in endothelial cells. Conclusions: Hypoxia or chemical hypoxia regulates PTN and PTPRZ1 expressions to restrict the stimulatory effects of hypoxia on endothelial and cancer cell migration.

AB ETS-1 plays an important role in angiogenesis and cancer invasion, and hypoxia is a common feature in these phenomena. We examined whether hypoxia influenced ETS-1 expression. Hypoxia induced ETS-1 in a human bladder cancer cell line, T24, and promoter analysis revealed that the deletion of -424 to -279 bp from the human ETS-1 promoter decreased the hypoxia-mediated inducibility. This region contained a hypoxia responsive element-like sequence, and HIF-1 bound to it under the hypoxic condition. Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides of this sequence as a decoy inhibited the hypoxia-mediated induciblity. These results indicate that hypoxia induces ETS-1 via the activity of HIF-1.

AB Respiratory muscle fatigue is of interest in mammalian physiology and respiratory medicine because it often complicates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contributes to respiratory failure. In this work, the rat diaphragm was used as a model to study the mechanism by which hypoxia accelerates the development of fatigue. 30 preparations were continuously stimulated by 20 V pulses with a duration of 2 ms and a frequency of 1.0 Hz. Responses were assessed at three time periods: 3, 6 and 9 min. Hypoxia considerably accelerated the rate of force decline in comparison with normoxia. Theophylline 10(-3)M significantly counteracted the action of hypoxia, but failed to do so in the presence of verapamil 10(-5)M. It is concluded that the action of hypoxia was brought about through interference with intracellular calcium activity. Theophylline, by facilitating the release of more intracellular calcium, opposed the action of hypoxia.

AB Acclimatization to hypoxia increases the hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) in mammals. The literature on humans shows that several protocols can quantify this increase in HVR if isocapnia is maintained, regardless of the exact level of PaCO2. In rats, the isocapnic HVR also increases with chronic hypoxia and this cannot be explained by a non-specific effect of increased ventilatory drive on the HVR. Changes in arterial pH are predicted to increase the HVR during chronic hypoxia in rats but this has not been quantified. Limitations in determining mechanisms of change in the HVR from reflex experiments are discussed. Chronic hypoxia changes some, but not all, indices of ventilatory motor output that are useful for normalization between experiments on anesthetized rats. Finally, ducks also show rime-dependent increases in ventilation during chronic hypoxia and birds provide a good experimental model to study reflex interactions. However, reflexes from intrapulmonary CO2 chemoreceptors can complicate the measurement of changes in the isocapnic HVR during chronic hypoxia in birds. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Tumor resistance to ionizing irradiation and cancer cell's metastasis stimulated by radiation often lead to anti-cancer failure, and can be negatively caused by a key role cellular hypoxia. In this regard, the exploitation of hypoxia-specific cytotoxic agents which assist to potentiate the anti-tumor effect of radiotherapy (RT) as well as efficiently counteract radiation-/hypoxia-induced cancer cell metastasis, becomes especially important, but has been widely overlooked. Herein, a core/shell-structured multifunctional nanoradiosensitizer with upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) as an inside core, mesoporous silica as the shell and a cavity in between, has been constructed, in which UCNP core serves as radiation dose amplifiers and bio-reductive pro-drug tirapazamine (TPZ) loaded in cavity is an hypoxia-selective cytotoxin and the silica shell provides the protection and diffusion path for TPZ. Such nanoradiosensitizer has been employed to inhibit the hypoxia-reoxygenation and the subsequent replication of cancer cells that often occurs after a single unaccompanied RT at low doses, and to silence the expression of transcription factors that support the progression of malignancy in cancer. This study confirms the radiotherapeutic benefits of utilizing nanoradiosensitizer as adjuvant to low-dose RT, and the results demonstrate the highly efficient hypoxia-specific killing in oxygen-dependent anti-tumor therapies.

AB Increasing evidence has showed that hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF1) has an important role in hypoxia-induced lipid accumulation, a common feature of solid tumors; however, its role remains to be fully elucidated. Adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), a structural protein of lipid droplets, is found to be upregulated under hypoxic conditions. In the present study, an MCF7 breast cancer cell line was used to study the role of ADRP in hypoxia-induced lipid accumulation. It was demonstrated that hypoxia induced the gene expression of ADRP in a HIF1-dependent manner. Increases in the mRNA and protein levels of ADRP was accompanied by increased HIF1A activity. In addition, a significant decrease in the mRNA and protein levels of ADRP were detected in presence of siRNA targeting HIF1A. Using a dual-luciferase reporting experiment and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, the present study demonstrated that ADRP is a direct target gene of HIF1, and identified a functional hypoxia response element localized 33 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site of the ADRP gene. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated the role of ADRP in low density liporotein (LDL) and very-LDL uptake-induced lipid accumulation under hypoxia. The knockdown of ADRP did not reduce HIF1-induced lipid accumulation under hypoxia. Together, these results showed that ADRP may be not involved in HIF1-induced lipid accumulation.

AB INTRODUCTION: Dysphagia is a frequent problem in various neurological disorders. However, knowledge on swallowing function in patients with cerebral hypoxia is sparse. The objective of this study is to report the development of swallowing function in a series of adolescent and young-adult patients with cerebral hypoxia.
   METHODS: We recruited eight patients (1 male) who were admitted to our institution after the acute phase following cerebral hypoxia. Each patient underwent detailed neurological evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), standardized neurophysiological assessment and repeated clinical and fiber-endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. Furthermore, all patients received daily physical and occupational therapy and intensive logopedic therapy for swallowing.
   RESULTS: Mean age in this case series was 19.9 +/- 3.6 years (range 16-25). All eight patients initially displayed severe swallowing dysfunction, but the reflexive components of swallowing were intact in seven patients without brainstem lesions. The only patient with additional brainstem involvement initially suffered from absence of an intact swallowing reflex and developed silent aspiration. However, follow-up examinations revealed intact swallowing reflexes in all eight patients.
   DISCUSSION: Dysphagia is common in patients with cerebral hypoxia, mainly resulting in a delayed oral phase consistent with impaired volitional execution of swallowing. Additional lesions in the brainstem may affect the integrity of the central pattern-generating circuitry for swallowing, resulting in additional dysfunction of the non-volitional reflexive component. In conclusion, dysphagia in patients with cerebral hypoxia is a common complication particularly in the early stages of remission, while long-term prognosis with respect to swallowing is often good. Swallowing function should be closely monitored in patients with acquired brain injury.

AB A sufficient supply molecular oxygen is essential for the maintenance of physiologic metabolism and bioenergetic homeostasis for most metazoans. For this reason, mechanisms have evolved for eukaryotic cells to adapt to conditions where oxygen demand exceeds supply (hypoxia). These mechanisms rely on the modification of pre-existing proteins, translational arrest and transcriptional changes. The hypoxia inducible factor (HIF; a master regulator of gene induction in response to hypoxia) is responsible for the majority of induced gene expression in hypoxia. However, much less is known about the mechanism(s) responsible for gene repression, an essential part of the adaptive transcriptional response. Hypoxia-induced gene repression leads to a reduction in energy demanding processes and the redirection of limited energetic resources to essential housekeeping functions. Recent developments have underscored the importance of transcriptional repressors in cellular adaptation to hypoxia. To date, at least ten distinct transcriptional repressors have been reported to demonstrate sensitivity to hypoxia. Central among these is the Repressor Element-1 Silencing Transcription factor (REST), which regulates over 200 genes. In this review, written to honor the memory and outstanding scientific legacy of Lorenz Poellinger, we provide an overview of our existing knowledge with respect to transcriptional repressors and their target genes in hypoxia.

AB Hypoxia in solid tumors is associated with aggressive behavior and poor outcome. We recently discovered that hypoxia alters the expression of differentiation marker genes in neuroblastoma cells, in that the tumor cells adjust to the hypoxic environment by down-regulating genes associated with a neuronal and upregulating genes associated with a neural crest-like phenotype. As there is a correlation in neuroblastoma between low stage of differentiation and high (aggressive) clinical stage, we propose that dedifferentiation of neuroblastoma cells in hypoxic tumor regions contribute to the malignancy of the tumor.

AB Immune outcomes are key mediators of many health benefits of exercise and are determined by exercise type, dose (frequency/duration, intensity), and individual characteristics. Similarly, reduced availability of ambient oxygen (hypoxia) modulates immune functions depending on the hypoxic dose and the individual capacity to respond to hypoxia. How combined exercise and hypoxia (e.g., high-altitude training) sculpts immune responses is not well understood, although such combinations are becoming increasingly popular. Therefore, in this paper, we summarize the impact on immune responses of exercise and of hypoxia, both independently and together, with a focus on specialized cells in the innate and adaptive immune system. We review the regulation of the immune system by tissue oxygen levels and the overlapping and distinct immune responses related to exercise and hypoxia, then we discuss how they may be modulated by nutritional strategies. Mitochondrial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory mechanisms underlie many of the adaptations that can lead to improved cellular metabolism, resilience, and overall immune functions by regulating the survival, differentiation, activation, and migration of immune cells. This review shows that exercise and hypoxia can impair or complement/synergize with each other while regulating immune system functions. Appropriate acclimatization, training, and nutritional strategies can be used to avoid risks and tap into the synergistic potentials of the poorly studied immune consequences of exercising in a hypoxic state.

AB Efforts to assess the ecological impacts of the marked increase in coastal hypoxia worldwide have been hampered by a lack of biomarkers of hypoxia exposure in marine benthic organisms. Here, we show that hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) transcript levels in the heart and cerebral ganglion of mantis shrimp (Oratosquilla oratoria) collected from hypoxic sites in Tokyo Bay are elevated several-fold over those in shrimp collected from normoxic sites. Upregulation of HIF-1 alpha mRNA levels in the heart after exposure to sub-lethal hypoxia was confirmed in controlled laboratory experiments. HIF-1 alpha transcript levels were increased at approximately threefold after 7 and 14 days of hypoxia exposure and declined to control levels within 24 h of restoration to normoxic conditions. The results provide the first evidence for upregulation of HIF-1 alpha transcript levels in two hypoxia-sensitive organs, heart and cerebral ganglion, in a marine invertebrate exposed to environmental hypoxia. These results suggest that upregulation of HIF-1 alpha transcript levels is an important component in adaptation of mantis shrimp to chronic hypoxia and is a potentially useful biomarker of environmental hypoxia exposure.

AB Hypoxia isolated to the carotid body (CB) can induce time-dependent progressive hyperventilation (ventilatory acclimatization) in the absence of brain hypoxia. The studies reported in this paper were designed to determine if CNS hypoxia in the absence of CB hypoxia would affect ventilation over a 4 h period. In addition, the effect of 4 h of CNS hypoxia on the ventilatory responses to central chemoreceptor stimulation and to isolated CB stimulation were also determined. The studies were carried out in awake goats with CB blood gases controlled by an extracorporeal circuit while systemic (CNS) blood gases were determined independently by the level of inhaled gases. Systemic arterial P(O2) was reduced to 40 Torr while the CB was maintained normoxic and normocapnic. Systemic arterial P(CO2) was kept isocapnic. The data obtained indicate that 4 h of CNS hypoxia produced mild hyperventilation that reached a peak after 30 min of hypoxia and was sustained for the entire period of hypoxia. There was no evidence of a time-dependent progressive hyperventilation, i.e. no acclimatization. In contrast to studies in which whole body hypoxia is induced, CNS hypoxia did not result in any changes in the ventilatory responses to either central or peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation after return to normoxic conditions. These findings suggest no significant role for CNS mechanisms induced by hypoxia in ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia in goats.

AB Oxygen is a key molecule for efficient energy production in living organisms. Although aerobic organisms have adaptive processes to survive in low-oxygen environments, it is poorly understood how lipolysis, the first step of energy production from stored lipid metabolites, would be modulated during hypoxia. Here, we demonstrate that fasting-induced lipolysis is downregulated by hypoxia through the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling pathway. In Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian adipocytes, hypoxia suppressed protein kinase A (PKA)-stimulated lipolysis, which is evolutionarily well conserved. During hypoxia, the levels of PKA activity and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) protein were downregulated, resulting in attenuated fasting-induced lipolysis. In worms, HIF stabilization was sufficient to moderate the suppressive effect of hypoxia on lipolysis through ATGL and PKA inhibition. These data suggest that HIF activation under hypoxia plays key roles in the suppression of lipolysis, which might preserve energy resources in both C. elegans and mammalian adipocytes.

AB The present study aimed at examining beneficial effects of intermittent hypoxia training (IHT) under prediabetic conditions. We investigate the effects of three-week IHT on blood glucose level, tolerance to acute hypoxia, and leukocyte mRNA expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and its target genes, i.e. insulin receptor, facilitated glucose transporter-solute carrier family-2, and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J. Seven healthy and 11 prediabetic men and women (44-70 years of age) were examined before, next day and one month after three-week IHT (3 sessions per week, each session consisting 4 cycles of 5-min 12% O-2 and 5-min room air breathing). We found that IHT afforded beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis in patients with prediabetes reducing fasting glucose and during standard oral glucose tolerance test. The most pronounced positive effects were observed at one month after IHT termination. IHT also significantly increased the tolerance to acute hypoxia (i.e. SaO(2) level at 20th min of breathing with 12% O-2) and improved functional parameters of respiratory and cardiovascular systems. IHT stimulated HIF-1 alpha mRNA expression in blood leukocytes in healthy and prediabetic subjects, but in prediabetes patients the maximum increase was lagged. The greatest changes in mRNA expression of HIF-1 alpha target genes occurred a month after IHT and coincided with the largest decrease in blood glucose levels. The higher expression of HIF-1 alpha was positively associated with higher tolerance to hypoxia and better glucose homeostasis. In conclusion, our results suggest that IHT may be useful for preventing the development of type 2 diabetes.

AB Chronic hypoxia leads to muscle atrophy. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are not well defined in vivo. We sought to determine how chronic hypoxia regulates molecular markers of protein synthesis and degradation in human skeletal muscle and whether these regulations were related to the regulation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. Eight young male subjects lived in a normobaric hypoxic hotel (FiO(2) 14.1%, 3,200 m) for 15 days in well-controlled conditions for nutrition and physical activity. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained in the musculus vastus lateralis before (PRE) and immediately after (POST) hypoxic exposure. Intramuscular hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) protein expression decreased(-49%, P=0.03), whereas hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2 alpha) remained unaffected from PRE to POST hypoxic exposure. Also, downstream HIF-1a target genes VEGF-A (-66%, P=0.006) and BNIP3 (-24%, P=0.002) were downregulated, and a tendency was measured for neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally Nedd4 (-47%, P=0.07), suggesting lowered HIF-1 alpha transcriptional activity after 15 days of exposure to environmental hypoxia. No difference was found on microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 type II/I (LC3b-II/I) ratio, and P62 protein expression tended to increase (+45%, P=0.07) compared to PRE exposure levels, suggesting that autophagy was not modulated after chronic hypoxia. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway was not altered as Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin, S6 kinase 1, and 4E-binding protein 1 phosphorylation did not change between PRE and POST. Finally, myofiber cross-sectional area was unchanged between PRE and POST. In summary, our data indicate that moderate chronic hypoxia differentially regulates HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha, marginally affects markers of protein degradation, and does not modify markers of protein synthesis or myofiber cross-sectional area in human skeletal muscle.

AB Ventilatory response to sustained isocapnic hypoxia in adult humans and other mammals is characterized by a biphasic pattern, with attenuation of neuromotor output to the diaphragm. However, there is no a priori reason that hypoxia-mediated attenuation of respiratory drive would be a common event among other respiratory muscles. At present, little is known about the function of the chest wall muscles during sustained hypoxia. As an obligatory inspiratory muscle with potential to act as a surrogate for neural drive to the relatively inaccessible costal diaphragm, parasternal intercostal has gained interest clinically: its function during a sustained hypoxic insult, as may occur in respiratory failure, warrants investigation. Therefore, in 11 chronically instrumented awake canines, we simultaneously recorded muscle length and shortening and electromyogram (EMG) activity of the parasternal chest wall inspiratory muscle, along with breathing pattern, during moderate levels of sustained isocapnic hypoxia lasting 20-25 min (mean 80 +/- 2% oximeter oxygen saturation). Phasic inspiratory shortening and EMG activity of the parasternal intercostal were observed throughout room air and hypoxic ventilation in all animals. Temporal changes in parasternal intercostal shortening tracked the biphasic changes in ventilation during sustained hypoxia. Mean shortening and EMG activity of parasternal intercostal muscle increased significantly with initial hypoxia (P < 0.01) and then markedly declined with constant hypoxia (P < 0.05). We conclude that attenuation of central neural respiratory drive extends to the primary chest wall inspiratory muscle, the parasternal intercostal, during sustained hypoxia, thus directly contributing to biphasic changes in ventilation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY With the potential to act as a surrogate for the generally inaccessible costal diaphragm, parasternal intercostal has gained great interest clinically as a muscle to monitor neural drive and function in respiratory disease. This study demonstrates for the first time the impact of sustained hypoxia on neural activation and mechanical contraction of the parasternal intercostals. Parasternal intercostals reveal a biphasic action during the time-dependent hypoxic response, with a transient increase in shortening and EMG activity with acute hypoxia followed by a progressive decline when hypoxia is sustained.

AB The absolute reliance of the mammalian brain on oxygen to generate ATP renders it acutely vulnerable to hypoxia, whether at high altitude or in clinical settings of anemia or pulmonary disease. Hypoxia is pivotal to the pathogeneses of myriad neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Conversely, reduced environmental oxygen, e.g. sojourns or residing at high altitudes, may impart favorable effects on aging and mortality. Moreover, controlled hypoxia exposure may represent a treatment strategy for age-related neurological disorders. This review discusses evidence of hypoxia's beneficial vs. detrimental impacts on the aging brain and the molecular mechanisms that mediate these divergent effects. It draws upon an extensive literature search on the effects of hypoxia/altitude on brain aging, and detailed analysis of all identified studies directly comparing brain responses to hypoxia in young vs. aged humans or rodents. Special attention is directed toward the risks vs. benefits of hypoxia exposure to the elderly, and potential therapeutic applications of hypoxia for neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, important questions for future research are discussed.

AB Intratumoral heterogeneity is an important factor contributing to metastasis and therapy resistance. The phenotypic diversity of cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment is strongly influenced by microenvironmental factors such as hypoxia. Clinically, hypoxia and the hypoxia inducible transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2 are associated with cancer stem cells, metastasis and drug resistance in multiple tumor types. Experimental models have demonstrated an important functional role for HIF signaling in driving CSC, metastatic and drug resistant phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. Here we will review recent studies that highlight novel mechanisms by which hypoxia promotes cancer stem cell, metastatic and drug resistant phenotypes.

AB Whilst hypoxia is increasingly recognised as a limiting factor in the successful treatment of solid tumours by conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy, its unique occurrence in such tumours is also viewed as offering the possibility of selective chemotherapy. Prodrugs designed to be selectively activated in hypoxic tissue by oxygen-sensitive reductases have been a common design motif for some time, and include such chemical classes as quinones, nitro-aromatics, aliphatic and heteroaromatic N-oxides, and transition metal complexes. This review discusses the mechanistic aspects of the activation of such prodrugs and the key overall properties needed. Prominent among the latter properties are efficient extravascular diffusion of the prodrug to the tumour, and back-diffusion of the activated drug (effector) in the tumour. The appropriate design of clinical trials for these prodrugs is also important. Exciting new mechanisms for prodrug research include activation by therapeutic radiation and the use of hypoxia-selective gene therapy vectors, such as Clostridia.

AB Cancer therapy faces considerable challenges due to the gaps in the understanding of the interlinked aspects of the relevant modalities. Hypoxia, altered circadian rhythms, and altered redox rhythms are some of the central and therapeutically targetable, relevant modalities. Recent studies suggest the existence of bi-directional crosstalk between hypoxia-circadian rhythm, hypoxia-redox rhythm, and redox-circadian rhythms. However, the interconnections between the three modalities are not yet established in cancer pathophysiology. This work reviews the recent investigations on the interconnected roles of circadian clock oscillations, redox oscillations, and hypoxia in cancer. Based on the available data, we highlight the gating of the hypoxic signaling pathway by the two oscillatory systems. An understanding of the molecular coupling is expected to result in better cancer therapies through drugs that modify circadian rhythm, redox rhythm, and hypoxia.

AB Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is widely used in perioperative settings for analgesia and sedation; however, little is known about its effects on the hypoxia-induced progression of tumor cells. In the present study, the effects of DEX on hypoxia-induced growth and metastasis of lung cancer cells and colorectal cancer cells was examined. A549 cells and HCT116 cells were treated with normoxia, hypoxia, co-treatment of hypoxia and DEX, and atipamezole (an alpha(2) adrenoceptor antagonist) for 4 h. The proliferation rate of cells was determined by MTT assays. Cell metastatic potential was evaluated by Transwell assays. Survivin and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha were detected by western blotting. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. It was demonstrated that hypoxia treatment promoted the proliferation and may promote the metastasis of the two cancer cell lines. DEX substantially contributed to the survival and aggressiveness of the two cancer cell lines following hypoxia. Furthermore, DEX upregulated the expression of survivin, MMP-2, MMP-9 and HIF-1 alpha in the two cancer cell lines in response to hypoxia. Finally, the effects of DEX on the hypoxia-induced growth and metastatic potential of cancer cells were reversed by atipamezole. Collectively, DEX enhances the hypoxia-induced progression of lung cancer cells and colorectal cancer cells by regulating HIF-1 alpha signaling, which may be associated with the alpha(2) adrenoceptor pathway.

AB Hypoxia is arguably the first recognized cancer microenvironment hallmark and affects virtually all cellular populations present in tumors. During the past decades the complex adaptive cellular responses to oxygen deprivation have been largely elucidated, raising hope for new anti cancer agents. Despite undeniable preclinical progress, therapeutic targeting of tumor hypoxia is yet to transition from bench to bedside. This review focuses on new pharmacological agents that exploit tumor hypoxia or interfere with hypoxia signaling and discusses strategies to maximize their therapeutic impact.

AB The developing nervous system depends upon precise regulation of oxygen levels. Hypoxia, the condition of low oxygen concentration, can interrupt developmental sequences and cause a range of molecular, cellular and neuronal changes and injuries. The roles and effects of hypoxia on the central nervous system (CNS) are poorly characterized, even though hypoxia is simultaneously a normal component of development, a potentially abnormal environmental stressor in some settings, and a clinically important complication, for example of prematurity. Work over the past decade has revealed that hypoxia causes specific disruptions in the development of CNS connectivity, altering axon pathfinding and synapse development. The goals of this article are to review hypoxia's effects on the development of CNS connectivity, including its genetic and molecular mediators, and the changes it causes in CNS circuitry and function due to regulated as well as unintended mechanisms. The transcription factor HIF1 alpha is the central mediator of the CNS response to hypoxia (as it is elsewhere in the body), but hypoxia also causes a dysregulation of gene expression. Animals appear to have evolved genetic and molecular responses to hypoxia that result in functional behavioral alterations to adapt to the changes in oxygen concentration during CNS development. Understanding the molecular pathways underlying both the normal and abnormal effects of hypoxia on CNS connectivity may reveal novel insights into common neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, this Review explores the current gaps in knowledge, and suggests important areas for future studies.

AB To investigate whether hypoxia extends into the post-hemodialysis period, nine clinically stable-end stage renal disease patients were dialyzed against bicarbonate and one against an acetate batch, ail with bioincompatible dialyzers. None had clinical evidence of cardiopulmonary overload on the day of the study Using an oximeter with internal memory, oxygen saturation was monitored continuously at the beginning, during, and for lour hours after hemodialysis. Hypoxia was defined as oxygen saturation less than 85%. Three patients had no hypoxia during or after. dialysis. Hypoxia occurred in five patients both during and after dialysis, and in two patients only in the post-dialysis period. Episodes of hypoxia were of longer duration and severity in post-dialysis period. We conclude that significant hypoxia can occur in the post-hemodialysis period.

AB BackgroundHead and neck cancer (HNC) is one of the most frequent malignancies in Asian males with a poor prognosis. Apart from well-known prognostic indicators, markers of tumor hypoxia can help us predict response to treatment and survival.MethodsA review of the literature on the present evidence and potential clinical importance of tumor hypoxia in head and neck cancer was carried out. The data obtained from the literature search is presented as a narrative review.ResultsThe literature shows possible associations between prognosis and low tumor oxygenation. Intermediate hypoxia biomarkers like HIF-1, GLUT-1, miRNA, and lactate, can help in predicting the response to therapy and survival as their altered expression is related to prognosis.ConclusionsHypoxia is common in HNC and can be detected by use of biomarkers. The tumors that show expression of hypoxia biomarkers have poor prognosis except for patients with human papilloma virus-associated or VHL-associated cancers. Therapeutic targeting of hypoxia is emerging; however, it is still in its nascent stage, with increasing clinical trials hypoxia is set to emerge as an attractive therapeutic target in HNC.

AB Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a general term to describe inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD affects approximately 1 in 200 individuals and exerts a significant health and quality of life burden on patients. Surgical intervention can be curative in ulcerative colitis but there is currently no cure for Crohn's disease. Since this is the case, and the fact that patients are often diagnosed at a young age, IBD exerts a significant financial burden on the health care system, and society as a whole.
   The underlying pathology of IBD is complex and involves a combination of genetic, environmental and microbial factors. Regardless of the underlying causes of the condition, this disease is universally characterized by disruption to the protective epithelial barrier separating the intestinal lumen above from the mucosal immune system below. Once this barrier becomes compromised a sequence of events ensues, that can occur in repetitive cycles to ensure long-term and serious damage to the gut.
   The role of hypoxia and hypoxia-dependent signalling pathways are increasingly appreciated to play a role in the physiology and pathophysiology of the intestine. The intestinal epithelium normally exists in a state of physiological hypoxia, with additional tissue hypoxia a feature of active inflammatory disease. Furthermore, recent pre-clinical animal studies have clearly supported the rationale for pharmacologically manipulating the oxygen-sensitive hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway in models of IBD. Thus, this review will discuss the contribution of hypoxia sensitive pathways in the pathology of IBD. Finally we will discuss the emerging evidence for manipulation of hypoxia-sensitive pathways in the treatment of IBD. (C) 2016 Institut Pasteur. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Conditions of poor oxygenation (hypoxia) are present in the majority of solid human tumors and are associated with poor patient prognosis due to both hypoxia-mediated resistance to treatment, and to hypoxia-induced biological changes that promote increased malignancy, including metastasis. Tumor cells respond to hypoxia by activating several oxygen-sensitive signaling pathways that include the hypoxia inducible factor 1/2 (HIF1/2) signalling pathways and the unfolded protein response (UPR), which alter gene expression to promote adaptation and survival during hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, these hypoxia responsive pathways can lead to changes in gene expression and cellular phenotype that influence the potential of cancer cells to metastasize. However, the hypoxia-induced signaling events that promote tumor metastasis are still relatively poorly understood. Previous studies have largely focused on the contribution of the HIF signaling pathway to hypoxia-mediated metastasis. However, recent evidence demonstrates that hypoxic activation of the UPR is also an important mediator of metastasis.

AB Ventilation is not constant during steady-state prolonged hypoxia. This raises questions as to the role of the carotid body (CB) in sustained hypoxia. Studies in awake goats using an extracorporeal CB circuit to allow separation of systemic (CNS) and CB blood gases provided evidence that prolonged hypoxia isolated to the CB causes time-dependent increased CB sensitivity to hypoxia, These findings were confirmed in recordings of afferent CB discharge in anesthetized goats, Studies in cats have been compatible with those in goats, It is concluded that prolonged hypoxic stimulation of the CB increases its sensitivity to hypoxia and is at least partly responsible for increased ventilatory drive during prolonged hypoxia such as during altitude acclimatization.

AB Endosialin is a transmembrane glycoprotein selectively expressed in blood vessels and stromal fibroblasts of various human tumours. It has been functionally implicated in angiogenesis, but the factors that control its expression have remained unclear. As insufficient delivery of oxygen is a driving force of angiogenesis in growing tumours, we investigated whether hypoxia regulates endosialin expression. Here, we demonstrate that endosialin gene transcription is induced by hypoxia predominantly through a mechanism involving hypoxia-inducible factor-2 (HIF-2) cooperating with the Ets-1 transcription factor. We show that HIF-2 activates the endosialin promoter both directly, through binding to a hypoxia-response element adjacent to an Ets-binding site in the distal part of the upstream regulatory region, and indirectly, through Ets-1 and its two cognate elements in the proximal promoter. Our data also suggest that the SP1 transcription factor mediates responsiveness of the endosialin promoter to high cell density. These findings elucidate important aspects of endosialin gene regulation and provide a rational frame for future investigations towards better understanding of its biological significance.

AB Hypoxia within solid tumors is often responsible for the failure of radiotherapy. The development of hypoxia-targeting nanomaterials - aimed at enhancing the effect of radiotherapy by electrical or heat effects and at modulating hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment - is a promising strategy to address this issue. We provide an overview of recently developed advanced materials that potentiate radiotherapy. First, we summarize novel materials for oxygen delivery or production to modify the tumor microenvironment, thus improving the effects of ionizing radiation. Second, we present new approaches for the design of high-Z element-based multifunctional nanoplatforms to enhance radiotherapy. Third, novel drug delivery systems for hypoxic regions and hypoxia-inducible factor-1-targeted therapies are discussed. Fourth, we establish the effectiveness of X-ray-or near-infrared-responsive nanoparticles for selectively triggering therapeutic effects under hypoxic conditions. Finally, this review emphasizes the importance of research in the field of nanomedicine focused on tumor hypoxia to improve clinical outcomes.

AB Hypoxia-inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) has been shown to mediate the transcriptional activation of its target genes in response to oxygen concentration, most likely via a pathway involving a specific oxygen sensor. Molecular cloning of HIF-1 has shown that this widely expressed, DNA binding transcription Factor is a heterodimer of two proteins, HIF-1 alpha and HIF-1 beta. A major control of HIF-1 activity by oxygen tension is achieved by changes in the level of the HIF-1 alpha subunit, which complexes with the constitutively expressed HIF-1 beta subunit. Such changes in HIF-1 alpha abundance occur via regulated stability, probably involving proteolysis, rather than at the level of transcription or translation. Further analysis has shown the existence of two separate regulatory domains in the C-terminus of the cu subunit. Thus, a mechanism of oxygen-regulated HIF-1 activation is proposed, which involves the operation of one inducible domain being amplified by changes in protein level conferred by a second regulatory domain. Evidence for a critical role of HIF-1 in the response of diverse target genes involved in cellular growth and metabolism comes from studies on cultured, mutant mouse cells that lack a functional HIF-1 beta subunit. Furthermore, studies on tumor xenografts derived from the mutant and wild-type cells show that HIF-1 is activated in vivo, and has major effects on gene expression in response to tumor hypoxia. Thus, HIF-1 is a critical component of the oxygen-signaling pathway, and is a prime candidate regulator molecule for the role of coordinating vascular oxygen supply with cellular growth and energy metabolism.

AB Resting vascular sympathetic outflow is significantly increased during and beyond exposure to acute hypoxia without a parallel increase in either resistance or pressure. This uncoupling may indicate a reduction in the ability of sympathetic outflow to effect vascular responses (sympathetic transduction). However, the effect of hypoxia on sympathetic transduction has not been explored. We hypothesized that transduction would either remain unchanged or be reduced by isocapnic hypoxia. In 11 young healthy individuals, we measured beat-by-beat pressure, multiunit sympathetic nerve activity, and popliteal blood flow velocity at rest and during isometric handgrip exercise to fatigue, before and during isocapnic hypoxia (similar to 80% SpO(2)), and derived sympathetic transduction for each subject via a transfer function that reflects Poiseuille's law of flow. During hypoxia, heart rate and sympathetic nerve activity increased, whereas pressure and flow remained unchanged. Both normoxic and hypoxic exercise elicited significant increases in heart rate, pressure, and sympathetic activity, although sympathetic responses to hypoxic exercise were blunted. Hypoxia slightly increased the gain relation between pressure and flow (0.062 +/- 0.006 vs. 0.074 +/- 0.004 cm.s(-1).mmHg(-1); P = 0.04), but markedly increased sympathetic transduction (-0.024 +/- 0.005 vs. -0.042 +/- 0.007 cm.s(-1).spike(-1); P < 0.01). The pressor response to isometric handgrip was similar during normoxic and hypoxic exercise due to the balance of interactions among the tachycardia, sympathoexcitation, and transduction. This indicates that the ability of sympathetic activity to affect vasoconstriction is enhanced during brief exposure to isocapnic hypoxia, and this appears to offset the potent vasodilatory stimulus of hypoxia.

AB Hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation impairs nitric oxide (NO)-mediated relaxation through the increase in superoxide generation in monkey coronary arteries. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), the target enzyme of NO, has been shown to change from the NO-sensitive reduced faun to the NO-insensitive oxidized/heme-free faun under substantial oxidative stress, so the present study investigated whether hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation influences sGC redox equilibrium. In isolated monkey coronary arteries without endothelium, the relaxation caused by the sGC stimulator BAY 41-2272 (E-max: 93.3% +/- 2.2%) was somewhat impaired under hypoxia (E-max: 86.3% +/- 2.6%) or hypoxia/reoxygenation (E-max: 86.1% +/- 3.2%), whereas that by the sGC activator BAY 60-2770 (E-max: 86.0% +/- 3.2%) was significantly augmented under hypoxia (E-max: 94.4% +/- 1.3%) or hypoxia/reoxygenation (E-max: 95.5% +/- 1.1%). In addition, cGMP formation in response to BAY 41-2272 and BAY 60-2770 was inhibited and stimulated, respectively, under hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation. The effects of hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation on BAY 41-2272 and BAY 60-2770 induced vasorelaxation were completely canceled by the treatment with the superoxide dismutase mimetic tempol. These findings suggest that sGC redox equilibrium in the coronary artery is shifted towards the NO-insensitive form under hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation and that superoxide seems to play an important role in this shift.

AB Wound healing is a complex multi-step process that requires spatial and temporal orchestration of cellular and non-cellular components. Hypoxia is one of the prominent microenvironmental factors in tissue injury and wound healing. Hypoxic responses, mainly mediated by a master transcription factor of oxygen homeostasis, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), have been shown to be critically involved in virtually all processes of wound healing and remodeling. Yet, mechanisms underlying hypoxic regulation of wound healing are still poorly understood. Better understanding of how the wound healing process is regulated by the hypoxic microenvironment and HIF-1 signaling pathway will provide insight into the development of a novel therapeutic strategy for impaired wound healing conditions such as diabetic wound and fibrosis. In this review, we will discuss recent studies illuminating the roles of HIF-1 in physiologic and pathologic wound repair and further, the therapeutic potentials of HIF-1 stabilization or inhibition.

AB AimTo evaluate the impact of hypoxia and hypoxia mimetic agents (HMA) on the formation and activity of spheroids by dental pulp cells (DPC).
   MethodologyDPC on agarose-coated plates were treated with hypoxia and the HMA dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG), desferrioxamine (DFO) and L-mimosine (L-MIM). Images of spheroids were taken directly after seeding and at 6h and 24h. Spheroid sizes were quantified by area measurement with ImageJ software. Viability was assessed with Live-Dead staining, MTT and resazurin-based toxicity assay. Production of VEGF, IL-8 and SDF-1 was evaluated using immunoassays. Data were analysed using Kruskal-Wallis test and post hoc Mann-Whitney U-test.
   ResultsDPC formed spheroids in the presence of hypoxia, HMA and combined treatment with hypoxia and HMA. No pronounced difference in spheroid size was found in the groups treated with hypoxia, DMOG, DFO, L-MIM and the combination of hypoxia and the HMA relative to their normoxic controls (P>0.05). Spheroids appeared vital in Live-Dead and MTT staining and the resazurin-based toxicity assay. Evaluation of protein production with immunoassays revealed significantly enhanced levels of VEGF and IL-8 (P<0.05), but there was no significant effect on SDF-1 production (P>0.05). Treatment with a combination of hypoxia and HMA did not further boost VEGF and IL-8 production (P>0.05).
   ConclusionsPre-conditioning with hypoxia and HMA increased the pro-angiogenic capacity of spheroids whilst not interfering with their formation. Pre-clinical studies will reveal whether pre-conditioning of spheroids with hypoxia and HMA can effectively improve the efficiency of cell transplantation approaches for regenerative endodontics.

AB Organ function is critically linked to the way tissues use available oxygen. In sepsis, tissue-related hypoxic injury is the result of hypoxemia and hypoperfusion and cytokine-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction termed cytopathic hypoxia. Organ dysfunction in sepsis is more likely related to derailment of the metabolic processes of cells to use available oxygen. Cellular dysoxia rather than hypoxia may be the most appropriate way of describing sepsis-related tissue injury. Lactate is a marker of aerobic mitochondrial dysfunction and anaerobic tissue metabolism and in some circumstances is considered the fuel of choice for certain tissues. The concept of cellular metabolic derangement or cytopathic hypoxia as a potential cause for multiorgan system dysfunction in sepsis may direct efforts to optimize outcome in septic patients from the classic targets of CO, tissue perfusion, DVo(2), and Vo(2) toward moderating sepsis-related early cytokine response, maximizing mitochondrial function, and using biomarkers to monitor treatment response.

AB The balance between vascular oxygen supply and metabolic demand for oxygen within the vasculature is tightly regulated. An imbalance leads to hypoxia and a consequential cascade of cellular signals that attempt to offset the effects of hypoxia. Hypoxia is invariably associated with atherosclerosis, wound repair, inflammation and vascular disease. There is now substantial evidence that hypoxia plays an essential role in angiogenesis as well as plaque angiogenesis. It controls the metabolism, and responses of many of the cell types found within the developing plaque and whether the plaque will evolve into a stable or unstable phenotype. Hypoxia is characterized in molecular terms by the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha, a subunit of the heterodimeric nuclear transcriptional factor HIF-1 and a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis. The expression of HIF-1 is localized to perivascular tissues, inflammatory macrophages and smooth muscle cells where it regulates several genes that are important to vascular function including vascular endothelial growth factor, nitric oxide synthase, endothelin-1 and erythropoietin. This chapter summarizes the effects of hypoxia on the functions of cells involved in angiogenesis as well as atherogenesis (plaque angiogenesis) and the evidence for its potential importance from experimental models and clinical studies.

AB Adaptation of the organism to hypoxia has profound effect on multiple tissues including regulation of erythropoiesis, vasculogenesis, a proper regulation of embryogenesis as well as other functions. The elucidation of those congenital or acquired mutations giving rise to disease states affecting physiological systems devoted to oxygen homeostasis provides not only a practical diagnostic and potential therapeutic target, but also allows to identify the essential, non-redundant physiological pathways that may be hitherto unknown, The erythropoietin gene was the first gene expression found to be upregulated by hypoxia; the mechanism of this regulation lead to our current understanding of hypoxia sensing. Thus it is appropriate that the disorders resulting from augmented erythropoiesis are subject of this review.

AB Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent angiogenesis has a crucial role in the corpus luteum formation and their functional maintenances in mammalian ovaries. A previous study by our group reported that activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha signaling contributes to the regulation of VEGF expression in the luteal cells (LCs) in response to hypoxia and human chorionic gonadotropin. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that HIF prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs) are expressed in LCs and overexpression of PHD2 attenuates the expression of VEGF induced by hypoxia in LCs. PHD2-overexpressing plasmid was transfected into LC2 cells, and successful plasmid transfection and expression was confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. In addition, the present study investigated changes of HIF-1 alpha and VEGF expression after incubation under hypoxic conditions and PHD2 transfection. PHD2 expression was significantly higher expressed than the other two PHD isoforms, indicating its major role in LCs. Moreover, a significant increase of VEGF mRNA expression was identified after incubation under hypoxic conditions, which was, however, attenuated by PHD2 overexpression in LCs. Further analysis also indicated that this hypoxia-induced increase in the mRNA expression of VEGF was consistent with increases in the protein levels of HIF-1a, which is regulated by PHD-mediated degradation. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that PHD2 is the main PHD expressed in LCs and hypoxia-induced VEGF expression can be attenuated by PHD2 overexpression through HIF-1 alpha-mediated mechanisms in LCs. This PHD2-mediated transcriptional activation may be one of the mechanisms regulating VEGF expression in LCs during mammalian corpus luteum development.

AB Rationale: Hypoxia induces leptin gene expression in human adipocytes via hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-alpha/beta). Under ambient moderate hypoxia, leptin in adipocytes is elevated for at least 14 days. Leptin is supposedly involved in the reduced food intake, increased utilization of fatty acids for energy production and possible weight loss observed at high altitudes. Literature on adiponectin and visfatin in high altitude is inconsistent with reports of elevated levels and non-elevated levels. Exercise in hypoxia studies in obese subjects have shown a significant weight loss after up to 3 weeks, but it is unclear if this effect holds up for longer time periods. Therefore, we aimed to investigate 32 obese subjects completing 52 exercise and rest sessions within 8 months at either moderate or sham hypoxia and to analyze leptin, adiponectin, and visfatin mRNA-expression at different time points of exposure.
   Methods: Abdominal subcutaneous fat biopsies were taken from 32 obese subjects before, after 3 months and after 8 months of intervention. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups and exercised at moderate intensity at two different study sites twice a week. The IG was exposed to normobaric hypoxia (FiO(2): 14.0 +/- 0.2%,) at exercise and at rest (FiO(2): 12.0 +/- 0.2%) and the CG to sham hypoxia. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used in order to determinem RNA-levels of leptin, adiponectin, and visfatin.
   Results: No differences in leptin levels after 3 and 8 months compared to baseline and between groups were found. There was no significant difference regarding adiponectin or visfatin at any time point compared to baseline in the hypoxia group, but an increase after 3 months was seen in the control group at normoxia compared to the hypoxia group (adiponectin: p = 0.029 and visfatin: p = 0.014).
   Conclusion: In this first several months' duration randomized sham controlled hypoxia exercise and rest study with obese subjects, we found no time extended leptin mRNA-expression in subjects under hypoxia after 3 and 8 months compared to baseline levels. Moderate exercise in normoxia not in hypoxia leads to elevated adiponectin and visfatin levels after 3 months.

AB Oxygen availability varies throughout the human body in health and disease. Under physiological conditions, oxygen availability drops from the lungs over the blood stream towards the different tissues into the cells and the mitochondrial cavities leading to physiological low oxygen conditions or physiological hypoxia in all organs including primary lymphoid organs. Moreover, immune cells travel throughout the body searching for damaged cells and foreign antigens facing a variety of oxygen levels. Consequently, physiological hypoxia impacts immune cell function finally controlling innate and adaptive immune response mainly by transcriptional regulation via hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Under pathophysiological conditions such as found in inflammation, injury, infection, ischemia and cancer, severe hypoxia can alter immune cells leading to dysfunctional immune response finally leading to tissue damage, cancer progression and autoimmunity. Here we summarize the effects of physiological and pathophysiological hypoxia on innate and adaptive immune activity, we provide an overview on the control of immune response by cellular hypoxia-induced pathways with focus on the role of HIFs and discuss the opportunity to target hypoxia-sensitive pathways for the treatment of cancer and autoimmunity.

AB Hypoxic hypoxia, including abnormally low partial pressure of inhaled oxygen, external respiratory dysfunction-induced respiratory hypoxia and venous blood flow into the arterial blood, is characterized by decreased arterial oxygen partial pressure, resulting in tissue oxygen deficiency. The specific characteristics include reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure and oxygen content. Hypoxic hypoxia diseases (HHDs) have attracted increased attention due to their high morbidity and mortality and mounting evidence showing that hypoxia-induced oxidative stress, coagulation, inflammation and angiogenesis play extremely important roles in the physiological and pathological processes of HHDs-related vascular endothelial injury. Interestingly, endothelial microvesicles (EMVs), which can be induced by hypoxia, hypoxia-induced oxidative stress, coagulation and inflammation in HHDs, have emerged as key mediators of intercellular communication and cellular functions. EMVs shed from activated or apoptotic endothelial cells (ECs) reflect the degree of ECs damage, and elevated EMVs levels are present in several HHDs, including obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, EMVs have procoagulant, proinflammatory and angiogenic functions that affect the pathological processes of HHDs. This review summarizes the emerging roles of EMVs in the diagnosis, staging, treatment and clinical prognosis of HHDs.

AB Background: CD8(+) type 2 cytotoxic T (T(C)2) cells undergo transcriptional reprogramming to IL-13 production in the presence of IL-4 to become potent, steroid-insensitive, pathogenic effector cells in asthmatic patients and in mice in a model of experimental asthma. However, no studies have described the effects of hypoxia exposure on T(C)2 cell differentiation.
   Objective: We determined the effects of hypoxia exposure on IL-13-producing CD8(+) T(C)2 cells.
   Methods: CD8(+) transgenic OT-1 cells differentiated with IL-2 and IL-4 (T(C)2 cells) were exposed to normoxia (21% oxygen) or hypoxia (3% oxygen), and IL-13 production in vitro was monitored. After differentiation under these conditions, cells were adoptively transferred into CD8-deficient mice, and lung allergic responses, including airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled methacholine, were assessed. The effects of pharmacologic inhibitors of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha were determined, as were responses in HIF-1 alpha-deficient OT-1 cells.
   Results: Under hypoxic conditioning, CD8(+) T(C)2 cell differentiation was significantly enhanced, with increased numbers of IL-13(+) T cells and increased production of IL-13 in vitro. Adoptive transfer of T(C)2 cells differentiated under hypoxic conditioning restored lung allergic responses in sensitized and challenged CD8-deficient recipients to a greater degree than seen in recipients of T(C)2 cells differentiated under normoxic conditioning. Pharmacologic inhibition of HIF-1 alpha or genetic manipulation to reduce HIF-1 alpha expression reduced the hypoxia-enhanced differentiation of T(C)2 cells, IL-13 production, and the capacity of transferred cells to restore lung allergic responses in vivo. IL-4-dependent, hypoxia-mediated increases in HIF-1 alpha and T(C)2 cell differentiation were shown to be mediated through activation of Janus kinase 1/3 and GATA-3.
   Conclusions: Hypoxia enhances CD8(+) T(C)2 cell-dependent airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation through HIF-1 alpha activation. These findings coupled with the known insensitivity of CD8(+) T cells to corticosteroids suggests that activation of the IL-4-HIF-1 alpha-IL-13 axis might play a role in the development of steroid-refractory asthma.

AB Many fish experience daily cycles of hypoxia in the wild, but the physiological strategies for coping with intermittent hypoxia are poorly understood. We examined how killifish adjust O-2 supply and demand during acute hypoxia, and how these responses are altered after prolonged acclimation to constant or intermittent patterns of hypoxia exposure. We acclimated killifish to normoxia (similar to 20 kPa O-2), constant hypoxia (2 kPa) or intermittent cycles of nocturnal hypoxia (12 h:12 h normoxia:hypoxia) for 28 days, and then compared whole-animal O-2 consumption rates (<(M)over dot>(O2)) and tissue metabolites during exposure to 12 h of hypoxia followed by reoxygenation in normoxia. Normoxia-acclimated fish experienced a pronounced 27% drop in <(M)over dot>(O2) during acute hypoxia, and modestly increased <(M)over dot>(O2) upon reoxygenation. They strongly recruited anaerobic metabolism during acute hypoxia, indicated by lactate accumulation in plasma, muscle, liver, brain, heart and digestive tract, as well as a transient drop in intracellular pH, and they increased hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha protein abundance in muscle. Glycogen, glucose and glucose-6-phosphate levels suggested that glycogen supported brain metabolism in hypoxia, while the muscle used circulating glucose. Acclimation to constant hypoxia caused a stable similar to 50% decrease in <(M)over dot>(O2) that persisted after reoxygenation, with minimal recruitment of anaerobic metabolism, suggestive of metabolic depression. By contrast, fish acclimated to intermittent hypoxia maintained sufficient O-2 transport to support normoxic <(M)over dot>(O2), modestly recruited lactate metabolism and increased <(M)over dot>(O2) dramatically upon reoxygenation. Both groups of hypoxia-acclimated fish had similar glycogen, ATP, intracellular pH and HIF-1 alpha levels as normoxic controls. We conclude that different patterns of hypoxia exposure favour distinct strategies for matching O-2 supply and O-2 demand.

   Introduction: Military aircrew are trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoxia in a safe environment using a variety of methods to simulate altitude. In order to investigate the effectiveness of hypoxia training, this study compared the recall of hypoxia symptoms in military aircrew between two consecutive hypobaric chamber hypoxia training sessions conducted, on average, 4.5 yr apart. Methods: Previously trained subjects completed a questionnaire immediately before and after they underwent refresher hypoxia training and recorded the occurrence, order, and severity of symptoms experienced. Responses from refresher training were compared with their recall of symptoms experienced during previous training. Results: There was no difference in the recall of most hypoxia symptoms between training sessions. Slurred speech was recalled more frequently from previous training compared to refresher training (14 vs. 4 subjects), whereas hot/cold flushes were recalled less frequently from previous training compared to refresher training (5 vs. 17 subjects). There was a statistically significant difference in overall hypoxia score (10.3 vs. 8.3), suggesting that from memory subjects may underestimate the level of hypoxia experienced in previous training. Discussion: A high level of similarity between the recall of previously experienced hypoxia symptoms and recent experience supports the effectiveness of hypoxia training. These results replicate the finding of a 'hypoxia signature' reported by a previous study. Small differences in the recall of some symptoms and in overall hypoxia score highlight the importance of drawing attention to the more subtle symptoms of early hypoxia, and of using training techniques which optimize aircrew recall.

AB Decreased tissue oxygen tension is a component of many diseases. Although hypoxia can be secondary to a low inspired pO(2) or a variety of lung disorders, the commonest cause is ischemia due to an oxygen demand greater than the local oxygen supply. In tumors, low tissue pO(2) is often observed, most often due to a blood supply inadequate to meet the tumor's demands. Hypoxic tumor tissue is associated with increased resistance to therapy, In the heart tissue hypoxia is often observed in persistent low-flow states, such as hibernating myocardium. In patients with stroke, hypoxia has been associated with the penumbral region, where an intervention could preserve function. Despite the potential importance of oxygen levels in tissue, difficulty in making this measurement in vivo has limited its role in clinical decision making. A class of compounds known to undergo different intracellular metabolism depending on the availability of oxygen in tissue, the nitroimidazoles, have been advocated for imaging hypoxic tissue. When a nitroimidazole enters a viable cell the molecule undergoes a single electron reduction, to form a potentially reactive species. In the presence of normal oxygen levels the molecule is immediately reoxidized. This futile shuttling takes place for some time, before the molecule diffuses out of the cell. In hypoxic tissue the low oxygen concentration is not able to effectively compete to reoxidize the molecule and further reduction appears to take place, culminating in the association of the reduced nitroimidazole with various intracellular components. The association is not irreversible, since these agents clear from hypoxic tissue over time. Initial development of nitroimidazoles for in vivo imaging used radiohalogenated derivatives of misonidazole, such as fluoromisonidazole, some of which have recently been employed in patients. Two major problems with fluoromisonidazole are its relatively low concentration within the lesion and the need to wait several hours to permit clearance of the agent from the normoxic background tissue (contrast between lesion and background typically <2:1 at about 90 min after injection). Even with high-resolution positron emission tomographic imaging, this combination of circumstances makes successful evaluation of hypoxic lesions a challenge. Single-photon agents, with their longer half-lives and comparable biological properties, offer a greater opportunity for successful imaging. In 1992 technetium-99m labeled nitroimidazoles were described that seem to have at least comparable in vivo characteristics. Laboratory studies have demonstrated preferential binding of these agents to hypoxic tissue in the myocardium, in the brain, and in tumors. These investigations indicate that imaging can provide direct evidence of tissue with low oxygen levels that is viable. In the experimental setting this information is useful to plan a more aggressive approach to treating tumors, or revascularize a heart suffering ischemic dysfunction. Even from this early vantage point the utility of measuring tissue oxygen levels with external imaging suggests that hypoxia imaging could play a major role in clinical decision making.

AB Endothelin-1 (Et-1) is a vasoconstrictor peptide that plays an important role in the pathophysiology of hypertension, myocardial ischemia, and other diseases. We examined the mechanism of regulation the Et-1 mRNA expression in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) in response to hypoxia and cobalt. To determine whether the 5'-flanking region of Et-1 gene mediate transcriptional responses to cellular hypoxia, we constructed reporter plasmids in which Et-1 5'-flanking sequences of Et-1 gene were fused to luciferase coding sequences. Constructs, which contain native Et-1 sequence 5'-AACGTGCA-3', located between -118 and -125 in the opposite orientation as the transcriptional unit, mediate transcriptional response to hypoxia and cobalt. This responsiveness was inhibited by genistein, a tyrosine kinase selective inhibitor. Both hypoxia and cobalt induced binding of HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible-1 factor) to this Et-1 hypoxia responsive element in gel shift assays. Mutation in this sequence eliminated both the hypoxia-induced HIF-1 binding and luciferase expression. Using the supershift assay we have shown that this hypoxia responsive element binds HIF-1 alpha and HIF-1 beta proteins. Interestingly, genistein only slightly affected HIF-1 binding. These results indicate that the Et-1 gene contains HIF-1 binding hypoxia responsive elements which mediate transcriptional responses to hypoxia and cobalt in microvascular endothelial cells. Genistein appears to inhibit this response by affecting the transcriptional activity of the HIF-1 complex, without significantly affecting its DNA-binding properties.

AB Hypoxia is a major environmental stressor that can damage the oxidation metabolism of crustaceans. Glutaredoxin (Grx) is a key member of the thioredoxin superfamily and plays an important role in the host's defense against oxidative stress. At present, the role of Grx in response to hypoxia in crustaceans remains unclear. In this study, the full-length cDNA of Grx3 (SpGrx3) was obtained from the mud crab Scylla paramamosain, which contains a 129-bp 5 ' untranslated region, a 981-bp open reading frame, and a 1,183-bp 3 ' untranslated region. The putative SpGrx3 protein contains an N-terminal thioredoxin domain and two C-terminal Grx domains. SpGrx3 was expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest expression in the anterior gills. After hypoxia, SpGrx3 expression was significantly up-regulated in the anterior gills of mud crabs. The expression of Grx2 and glutathione S-transferases was decreased, while the expression of glutathione peroxidases was increased following hypoxia when SpGrx3 was silenced in vivo. In addition, the total antioxidant capacity of SpGrx3-interfered mud crabs was significantly decreased, and the malondialdehyde content was significantly increased during hypoxia. The subcellular localization data indicated that SpGrx3 was predominantly localized in the nucleus when expressed in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells. Moreover, overexpression of SpGrx3 reduced the content of reactive oxygen species in S2 cells during hypoxia. To further investigate the transactivation mechanism of SpGrx3 during hypoxia, the promoter region of the SpGrx3 was obtained by Genome Walking and three hypoxia response elements (HREs) were predicted. Dual-luciferase reporter assay results demonstrated that SpGrx3 was likely involved in the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway during hypoxia, which could be mediated through HREs. The results indicated that SpGrx3 is involved in regulating the antioxidant system of mud crabs and plays a critical role in the response to hypoxia.

AB Lumbroso D, Joseph V. Impaired acclimatization to chronic hypoxia in adult male and female rats following neonatal hypoxia. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 297: R421-R427, 2009. First published June 3, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00068.2009.-We tested the hypothesis that neonatal exposure to hypoxia alters acclimatization to chronic hypoxia later in life. Rat pups were exposed to normobaric hypoxia (12% O-2; nHx group) in a sealed chamber, or to normoxia (21% O-2; nNx group) from the day before birth to postnatal day 10. The animals were then raised in normal conditions until reaching 12 wk of age. At this age, we assessed ventilatory and hematological acclimatization to chronic hypoxia by exposing male and female nHx and nNx rats for 2 wk to 10% O-2. Minute ventilation, metabolic rate, hypoxic ventilatory response, hematocrit, and hemoglobin levels were measured both before and after acclimatization. We also quantified right ventricular hypertrophy as an index of pulmonary hypertension both before and after acclimatization. There was a significant effect of neonatal hypoxia that decreases ventilatory response ( relative to metabolic rate, (V) over dotE/(V) over dotCO(2)) to acute hypoxia before acclimatization in males but not in females. nHx rats had an impaired acclimatization to chronic hypoxia characterized by altered respiratory pattern and elevated hematocrit and hemoglobin levels after acclimatization, in both males and females. Right ventricular hypertrophy was present before and after acclimatization in nHx rats, indicating that neonatal hypoxia results in pulmonary hypertension in adults. We conclude that neonatal hypoxia impairs acclimatization to chronic hypoxia in adults and may be a factor contributing to the establishment of chronic mountain sickness in humans living at high altitude.

AB Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a characteristic locally aggressive tumor in which hypoxia levels are very high, causing a low response to chemotherapy and providing basic resistance to anticancer drugs. Tumoral hypoxia directly depends on hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF). The goal of this paper is to describe HIF basic biology and tumor cells (HIF-1 alpha, mainly), analyzing the effects of its expression in OSCC, study its relation with other molecules such as nitric oxide (NO), carbonic anhydrase (CA) or VEGF and assess the possibility of its manipulation as a therapeutic target.

AB Hypoxia, or the lack of oxygen, has multiple impacts on the vascular system. The major molecular sensors for hypoxia at the cellular level are hypoxia inducible factor and heme oxygenase. Hypoxia also acts on the vasculature directly conveying its damaging effects through disruption of the control of vascular tone, particularly in the coronary circulation, enhancement of inflammatory responses and activation of coagulation pathways. These effects could be particularly detrimental under pathological conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea and other breathing disorders.

AB Older individuals represent a growing population, in industrialized countries, particularly those with cardiovascular diseases, which remain the leading cause of death in western societies. Aging constitutes one of the largest risks for cardiovascular diseases. On the other hand, oxygen consumption is the foundation of cardiorespiratory fitness, which in turn is linearly related to mortality, quality of life and numerous morbidities. Therefore, hypoxia is a stressor that induces beneficial or harmful adaptations, depending on the dose. While severe hypoxia can exert detrimental effects, such as high-altitude illnesses, moderate and controlled oxygen exposure can potentially be used therapeutically. It can improve numerous pathological conditions, including vascular abnormalities, and potentially slows down the progression of various age-related disorders. Hypoxia can exert beneficial effects on inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial functions, and cell survival, which are all increased with age and have been discussed as main promotors of aging. This narrative review discusses specificities of the aging cardiovascular system in hypoxia. It draws upon an extensive literature search on the effects of hypoxia/altitude interventions (acute, prolonged, or intermittent exposure) on the cardiovascular system in older individuals (over 50 years old). Special attention is directed toward the use of hypoxia exposure to improve cardiovascular health in older individuals.

AB Cumulative acquisition of genetic alterations affecting oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes may select for tumor cell clones with enhanced proliferation and survival potential. As a result oxygen and nutrient consumption increases, leading to a tumor microenvironment characterized by low oxygen tension, low glucose levels, and an acidic pH. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF) are activated in response to hypoxia, apparently via reduced activity of the recently identified class of 2-oxoglutarate dependent oxygenases, as well as various tumor specific genetic alterations. A widespread HIF activation can be observed in a variety of malignant tumors. The HIF system induces adaptive responses including angiogenesis, glycolysis, and pH regulation which confer increased resistance towards the hostile tumor microenvironment. Apart from protumorigenic the wide-ranging HIF pathway may also have antitumorigenic components, which might, however, be counteracted by specific genetic mechanisms. Thus mounting evidence suggests that the HIF system plays a decisive role in tumor physiology and progression. Moreover, recent insight into this pathway has opened novel and potentially selective therapeutic approaches.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. An aberrant regulation of gene expression by miRNAs is associated with numerous diseases, including cancer. MiRNAs expression can be influenced by various stimuli, among which hypoxia; however, the effects of different types of continuous hypoxia (moderate or marked) on miRNAs are still poorly studied. Lately, some hypoxia-inducible miRNAs (HRMs, hypoxia-regulated miRNAs) have been identified. These HRMs are often activated in different types of cancers, suggesting their role in tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in miRNAs expression both in moderate continuous hypoxia and marked continuous hypoxia to better understand the possible relationship between hypoxia, miRNAs, and colorectal cancer. We used RT-PCR to detect the miRNAs expression in colorectal cancer cell lines in conditions of moderate and marked continuous hypoxia. The expression of miRNAs was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA test to compare the differential expression of miRNAs among groups. The levels of almost all analyzed miRNAs (miR-21, miR-23b, miR-26a, miR-27b, and miR-145) were greater in moderate hypoxia versus marked hypoxia, except for miR-23b and miR-21. This study identified a series of miRNAs involved in the response to different types of continuous hypoxia (moderate and marked), highlighting that they play a role in the development of cancer. To date, there are no other studies that demonstrate how these two types of continuous hypoxia could be able to activate different molecular pathways that lead to a different expression of specific miRNAs involved in tumorigenesis.

AB A critical goal of patient management for anesthesiologists and intensivists is to maintain oxygen homeostasis in patients admitted to operation theaters and intensive care units. For this purpose, it is imperative to understand the strategies of the body against oxygen imbalance-especially oxygen deficiency (hypoxia). Adaptation to hypoxia and maintenance of oxygen homeostasis involve a wide range of responses that occur at different organizational levels in the body. These responses are greatly influenced by perioperative patient management including factors such as perioperative drugs. Herein, the influence of perioperative patient management on the body's response to oxygen imbalance was reviewed with a special emphasis on hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), transcription factors whose activity are regulated by the perturbation of oxygen metabolism. The 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to three researchers who made outstanding achievements in this field. While previous studies have reported the effect of perioperatively used drugs on hypoxia-induced gene expression mediated by HIFs, this review focused on effects of subacute or chronic hypoxia changes in gene expression that are mediated by the transcriptional regulator HIFs. The clinical implications and perspectives of these findings also will be discussed. Understanding the basic biology of the transcription factor HIF can be informative for us since anesthesiologists manage patients during the perioperative period facing the imbalances the oxygen metabolism in organ and tissue. The clinical implications of hypoxia-dependent signaling in critical illness, including Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in which disturbances in oxygen metabolism play a major role in its pathogenesis will also be discussed.

AB Hypoxia plays a significant role in the development of various cerebral diseases, many of which are associated with the potential risk of recurrence due to mitochondrial damage. Conventional drug treatments are not always effective for hypoxia-related brain diseases, necessitating the exploration of alternative compounds. In this study, we investigated the potential of diphenyl diselenide [(PhSe)2] to ameliorate locomotor impairments and mitigate brain mitochondrial dysfunction in zebrafish subjected to hypoxia. Additionally, we explored whether these improvements could confer resistance to recurrent hypoxia. Through a screening process, an appropriate dose of (PhSe)2 was determined, and animals exposed to hypoxia received a single intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg of the compound or vehicle. After 1 h from the injection, evaluations were conducted on locomotor deficits, (PhSe)2 content, mitochondrial electron transport system, and mitochondrial viability in the brain. The animals were subsequently exposed to recurrent hypoxia to assess the latency time to hypoxia symptoms. The findings revealed that (PhSe)2 effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier, attenuated locomotor deficits induced by hypoxia, and improved brain mitochondrial respiration by modulating complex III. Furthermore, it enhanced mitochondrial viability in the telencephalon, contributing to greater resistance to recurrent hypoxia. These results demonstrate the beneficial effects of (PhSe)2 on both hypoxia and recurrent hypoxia, with cerebral mitochondria being a critical target of its action. Considering the involvement of brain hypoxia in numerous pathologies, (PhSe)2 should be further tested to determine its effectiveness as a potential treatment for hypoxia-related brain diseases.

AB Hypoxia in gliomas is associated with tumor resistance to radio- and chemotherapy. However, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of hypoxia remains challenging, and the validation of biological markers is, therefore, of great importance. We investigated the relationship between uptake of the PET hypoxia tracer [18F]-FMISO and other markers of hypoxia and angiogenesis and with patient survival.
   In this prospective single center clinical study, 33 glioma patients (grade IV: n = 24, III: n = 3, and II: n = 6) underwent [18F]-FMISO PET and MRI including relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps before surgery. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) and hypoxic volume were calculated, defining two groups of patients based on the presence or absence of [18F]-FMISO uptake. After surgery, molecular quantification of CAIX, VEGF, Ang2 (rt-qPCR), and HIF-1 alpha (immunohistochemistry) were performed on tumor specimens.
   [18F]-FMISO PET uptake was closely linked to tumor grade, with high uptake in glioblastomas (GB, grade IV). Expression of biomarkers of hypoxia (CAIX, HIF-1 alpha), and angiogenesis markers (VEGF, Ang2, rCBV) were significantly higher in the [18F]-FMISO uptake group. We found correlations between the degree of hypoxia (hypoxic volume and SUVmax) and expression of HIF-1 alpha, CAIX, VEGF, Ang2, and rCBV (p < 0.01). Patients without [18F]-FMISO uptake had a longer survival time than uptake positive patients (log-rank, p < 0.005).
   Tumor hypoxia as evaluated by [18F]-FMISO PET is associated with the expression of hypoxia markers on a molecular level and is related to angiogenesis. [18F]-FMISO uptake is a mark of an aggressive tumor, almost always a glioblastoma. Our results underline that [18F]-FMISO PET could be useful to guide glioma treatment, and in particular radiotherapy, since hypoxia is a well-known factor of resistance.

AB Epidemiologic studies have shown a clear association of adverse intrauterine environment and an increased risk of hypertension and coronary heart disease in the adult. Many studies have been focused on the effects of maternal undernutrition and fetal glucocorticoid exposure on fetal programming and later adult disease. Although it is relatively less clear, there is evidence that fetal exposure to hypoxia, alcohol, tobacco smoking, and cocaine may also cause in utero programming leading to an increased risk of adult disease. Chronic hypoxia during the course of pregnancy is thought to result in fetal intrauterine growth retardation. Among other effects, chronic hypoxia suppresses fetal cardiac function, alters cardiac gene expression, increases myocyte apoptosis, and results in a premature exit of the cell cycle of cardiomyocytes and myocyte hypertrophy. This review discusses recent evidence of an association of prenatal hypoxic exposure with an increased vulnerability of adult heart disease, and the possible mechanisms involved.

AB Increasing evidence supports the role of the tumor microenvironment in modulating cancer behavior. Tissue hypoxia, an important and common condition affecting the tumor microenvironment, is well established as a resistance factor in radiotherapy. Increasing evidence points to the ability of hypoxia to induce the expression of gene products, which confer aggressive tumor behavior and promote broad resistance to therapy. These factors suggest that determining the presence or absence of tumor hypoxia is important in planning cancer therapy. Recent advances in PET hypoxia imaging, conformal radiotherapy, and imaging-directed radiotherapy treatment planning now make it possible to perform hypoxia-directed radiotherapy. We review the biological aspects of tumor hypoxia and PET imaging approaches for measuring tumor hypoxia, along with methods for conformal radiotherapy and image-guided treatment, all of which provide the underpinnings for hypoxia-directed therapy. As a case example, we review emerging data on PET imaging of hypoxia to direct radiotherapy.

AB Tumor hypoxia is a common feature of the microenvironment in solid tumors, primarily due to an inadequate, and heterogeneous vascular network. It is associated with resistance to radiotherapy and results in a poorer clinical outcome. The presence of hypoxia in tumors can be identified by various invasive and non-invasive techniques, and there are a number of approaches by which hypoxia can be modified to improve outcome. However, despite these factors and the ongoing extensive pre-clinical studies, the clinical focus on hypoxia is still to a large extent lacking. Hypoxia is a major cellular stress factor and affects a wide range of molecular pathways, and further understanding of the molecular processes involved may lead to greater clinical applicability of hypoxic modifiers. This review is a discussion of the characteristics of tumor hypoxia, hypoxia-related molecular pathways, and the role of hypoxia in treatment resistance. Understanding the molecular aspects of hypoxia will improve our ability to clinically monitor hypoxia and to predict and modify the therapeutic response.

AB Oxygen (O-2) homeostasis is essential to the metazoan life. O-2-sensing or hypoxia-regulated molecular pathways are intimately involved in a wide range of critical cellular functions and cell survival from embryogenesis to adulthood. In this report, we have designed an innovative hypoxia sensor (O(2)CreER) based on the O-2-dependent degradation domain of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and Cre recombinase. We have further generated a hypoxia-sensing mouse model, R26-O(2)CreER, by targeted insertion of the O(2)CreER-coding cassette in the ROSA26 locus. Using the ROSA(mTmG) mouse strain as a reporter, we have found that this novel hypoxia-sensing mouse model can specifically identify hypoxic cells under the pathological condition of hind-limb ischemia in adult mice. This model can also label embryonic cells including vibrissal follicle cells in E13.5-E15.5 embryos. This novel mouse model offers a valuable genetic tool for the study of hypoxia and O-2 sensing in mammalian systems under both physiological and pathological conditions.

AB Both mild hypoxia and exogenous erythropoietin may protect the brain against subsequent severe hypoxia, and the conditioning effect of transient hypoxia is partly mediated by hypoxia-induced endogenous erythropoietin. We now observed in several experimental models that combining transient hypoxia and exogenous erythropoietin may cause neuronal damage. High-dose erythropoietin (40 IU/ml) profoundly impeded synaptic transmission of rat hippocampal slice cultures when used in conjunction with moderate hypoxia (10% O-2 for two 8-h periods). Addition of erythropoietin increased viability of cultured rat embryonic cortical neurons at 21% O-2 but decreased viability under hypoxic conditions (2% O-2) in a dose-dependent fashion. Death of human neuronal precursor cells challenged by oxygen and glucose deprivation was increased by erythropoietin when cells were cultured under hypoxic but not under normoxic conditions. In neonatal rats exposed to moderate hypoxia plus erythropoietin, numbers of degenerating cerebral neurons were increased, as compared to controls or rats subjected to either hypoxia or erythropoietin alone. Thus, erythropoietin may aggravate rather than ameliorate neuronal damage when administered during transient hypoxia. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of short-and long-term hypoxia on the depiction of cerebral veins in the susceptibility-weighted angiography (SWAN) sequence.
   Materials and Methods: In the context of a study on brain adaptation mechanisms to hypoxia, 16 healthy men (aged 20-28 years) were studied through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) under room air conditions, short-term-hypoxia (7 minutes before and during the MRI scan), and long-term hypoxia (8.5 hours before and during the MRI scan). Oxygen saturation was continuously measured using a finger-mounted pulse oximeter. Two independent blinded readers compared the 3 scans of each participant and graded the SWAN source images and minimum intensity projections according to the size, number, and signal intensity of the cerebral veins. Signal intensities of deep cerebral veins were measured, and signal intensity proportions of deep cerebral veins to different parenchymal brain regions were calculated.
   Results: Nine subjects could be included in the study. In all of them, both readers correctly distinguished the 2 hypoxia scans from the baseline scan, grading the SWAN images acquired under hypoxic conditions as visualizing cerebral veins more prominently. Signal intensities of the deep cerebral veins and signal intensity proportions were significantly lower in the hypoxia scans. No significant differences between short-term and long-term hypoxia were found on visual inspections and signal intensity measurements. This correlated with the results of the pulse oximetry: mean O-2 saturation values were 97.9% +/- 1.2% (baseline), 84.1% +/- 3.8% (short-term hypoxia), and 82.8% +/- 4.4% (long-term hypoxia), respectively.
   Conclusions: Hypoxia leads to visible and measurable changes in cerebral veins as depicted through SWAN. Possible clinical implications of this finding include stroke and tumor imaging and need further investigation.

AB Transport of glucose into most mammalian cells and tissues is rate-controlling for its metabolism. Glucose transport is acutely stimulated by hypoxic conditions, and the response is mediated by enhanced function of the facilitative glucose transporters (Glut), Glut1, Glut3, and Glut4. The expression and activity of the Glut-mediated transport is coupled to the energetic status of the cell, such that the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation resulting from exposure to hypoxia leads to a stimulation of glucose transport. The premise that the glucose transport response to hypoxia is secondary to inhibition of mitochondrial function is supported by the finding that exposure of a variety of cells and tissues to agents such as azide or cyanide, in the presence of oxygen, also leads to stimulation of glucose transport. The mechanisms underlying the acute stimulation of transport include translocation of Gluts to the plasma membrane (Glut1 and Glut4) and activation of transporters pre-exiting in the plasma membrane (Glut1). A more prolonged exposure to hypoxia results in enhanced transcription of the Glut1 glucose transporter gene, with little or no effect on transcription of other Glut genes. The transcriptional effect of hypoxia is mediated by dual mechanisms operating in parallel, namely, (1) enhancement of Glut1 gene transcription in response to a reduction in oxygen concentration per se, acting through the hypoxia-signaling pathway, and (2) stimulation of Glut1 transcription secondary to the associated inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation during hypoxia. Among the various hypoxia-responsive genes, Glut1 is the first gene whose rate of transcription has been shown to be dually regulated by hypoxia. In addition, inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation per se, and not the reduction in oxygen tension itself, results in a stabilization of Glut1 mRNA. The increase in cell Glut1 mRNA content, resulting from its enhanced transcription and decreased degradation, leads to increased cell and plasma membrane Glut1 content, which is manifested by a further stimulation of glucose transport during the adaptive response to prolonged exposure to hypoxia.

AB Introduction: The hypoxia marker IAZGP, 1-(6-deoxy-6-iodo-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-2-nitroimidazole, has been labeled with I-123/I-124/I-125/I-131 via iodine-radioiodine exchange, which gives the radiotracer in a specific activity of 10-90 MBq/mu mol. We synthesized the same radiotracer possessing several hundred to thousand times higher specific activity (high-SA IAZGP) via nucleophilic substitution and compared its biological behavior with that of conventionally produced IAZGP (low-SA IAZGP) to determine if specific activity is a factor influencing cell uptake kinetics, biodistribution and intratumor microregional localization of the radiotracer.
   Methods: High-SA [I-131]IAZGP was prepared by substitution of the tosyl functionality with [I-131]iodide. In vitro uptake of high- and low-SA [I-131]IAZGP by HCT8 and HT29 cells was assessed in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Biodistribution and intratumor localization of high- and low-SA [I-131]IAZGP were determined by injection into HT29 tumor-bearing mice.
   Results: The nucleophilic substitution reaction proceeded efficiently in acetonitrile at 150 degrees C, giving the Final product in an average yield of 42% and an average specific activity of 30 GBq/mu mol. In vitro, high-SA [I-131]IAZGP was incorporated into the tumor cells with similar kinetics and oxygen dependence to low-SA [I-131]IAZGP. In HT29 tumor-bearing mice, biodistributions of high- and low-SA [I-131]IAZGP were equivalent. Ex vivo autoradiography revealed heterogeneous intraturnor localization of high-SA [I-131]IAZGP corresponding closely to distributions of other exogenous and enclogenous hypoxia markers. Comparable rnicroregional distribution patterns were observed with low-SA [I-131]IAZGP.
   Conclusions: Radiolabeled IAZGP produced via nucleophilic Substitution is validated as an exogenous hypoxia marker. Specific activity does not appear to influence the in vivo hypoxia-mapping ability of the radiotracer. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Solid tumors containing more hypoxic regions show a more malignant phenotype by increasing the expression of genes encoding angiogenic and metastatic factors. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a master transcriptional activator of such genes, and thus, imaging and targeting hypoxic tumor cells where HIF-1 is active are important in cancer therapy. In the present study, HIF-1 activity was monitored via an optical in vivo imaging system by using a luciferase reporter gene under the regulation of an artificial HIF-1-dependent promoter, 5HRE. To monitor tumor hypoxia, we isolated a stable reporter-transfectant, HeLa/5HRE-Luc, which expressed more than 100fold luciferase in response to hypoxic stress, and observed bioluminescence from its xenografts. Immunohistochemical analysis of the xenografts with a hypoxia marker, pimonidazole, confirmed that the luciferase-expressing cells were hypoxic. Evaluation of the efficacy of a hypoxia-targeting prodrug, TOP3, using this optical imaging system revealed that hypoxic cells were significantly diminished by TOP3 treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis of the TOP3-treated xenografts confirmed that hypoxic cells underwent apoptosis and were removed after TOP3 treatment. These results demonstrate that this model system using the 5HRE-luciferase reporter construct provides qualitative information (hypoxic status) of solid tumors and enables one to conveniently evaluate the efficacy of cancer therapy on hypoxia in malignant solid tumors.

AB Hypoxia has been implicated as a stimulant of coagulation. As exertion is known to affect haemostasis, we sought to control for this by using a standardized protocol. Subjects were exercised both at room air and at 12% oxygen. Exercise produced an increase in procoagulant factors, which was reduced with hypoxic exercise. Room air exercise increased fibrinolytic markers. Hypoxic exercise did not affect the increase in tissue plasminogen activator, but decreased the increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression. Thus, it appears that hypoxia may exert an antithrombotic effect by both damping exercise-induced procoagulant changes and stimulating fibrinolysis.

AB Cytotrophoblast (CT) cells isolated and purified from term placenta are able to differentiate into syncytiotrophoblast cells. Previous reports suggested that hypoxia is an inhibitor of this differentiation and also increases apoptosis. As visual observations of our CT cell cultures indicated a better development in hypoxia than in normoxia (defined as 2.5 and 21 O-2, respectively), we decided to assess the effect of low oxygen tension on in vitro CT cell differentiation by measuring cell viability, apoptosis and CT cell fusion and differentiation. We observed a 45 decrease in cell viability 24 h after plating both in normoxia and in hypoxia but no difference between the two oxygen conditions. Cell viability remained stable during the 4-day culture. Apoptosis also did not increase in hypoxia. Apoptotic index and caspase activation were even lower in hypoxia than in normoxia at Day 1 and Day 4 of the culture. Finally, we observed a 5-fold and 6-fold increase in Syncytin-1 mRNA expression in normoxia and in hypoxia, respectively, indicating that hypoxia did not inhibit CT cell fusion. CT cells differentiated as well in hypoxia as an increase in inhibin subunit mRNA was evidenced during the 4-day culture. This increase was even higher in hypoxia than in normoxia. In conclusion, hypoxia defined as 2.5 O-2 based on first trimester placental pO(2) did not decrease term primary CT cell viability and did not increase apoptosis. Moreover, it did not inhibit either CT cell fusion or differentiation.

AB BACKGROUND Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is a transmembrane cell surface peptidase present on prostatic epithelial cells that catalytically inactivates small peptide substrates. Neutral endopeptidase loss is associated with prostate cancer growth, progression, and increased angiogenesis. We examined whether NEP expression is regulated by hypoxia, frequently encountered in the tumor microenvironment. METHODS NEP expression was compared in prostate cancer cell lines cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The NEP activity, protein levels, and mRNA levels were determined using enzyme assay, Western blotting and q-PCR analysis, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) was used to confirm the negative regulation of NEP at the transcriptional level by hypoxia responsive elements (HREs). RESULTS The results indicate that NEP expression was inhibited under hypoxic conditions in the NEP positive LNCaP, C4-2, and 22RV1 cells and human umbilical vascular endothelial (HUVEC) cells. NEP regulation appeared to be predominantly at the transcriptional level as NEP mRNA expression significantly reduced with hypoxia, concordant with the kinetics of protein levels, and NEP enzyme activity. A search of the NEP gene sequence revealed three putative HREs upstream of the NEP promoter. Two of the HREs demonstrated a specific reduction of shift in the presence of cobalt chloride; specificity of the binding sites was confirmed by ChIP. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate a novel mechanism where hypoxia negatively regulates the tumor suppressor function of NEP in prostate cancer. The negative regulation of NEP is mediated by binding of the HIF1- protein binding to the HREs present upstream of the NEP promoter. Prostate 73: 706714, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Hypoxia is a characteristic feature of many solid tumors which has been described in a wide range of tumor types. Its presence impairs the effectiveness of common anti-cancer therapies and accordingly, tumor hypoxia has been associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype, poor response to radio-and chemotherapy, and worse prognosis. In order to predict outcome and identify patients with a worse prognosis and/or patients that would benefit from appropriate treatments, in vivo measurement of tumor hypoxia is required. Given the difficulties associated with invasive methods, a non-invasive method is of major clinical interest. Although several candidate molecules have been labeled with PET and SPECT labels, none of them is used in daily clinical routine due to a number of difficulties that complicate their use. This review aims to give an overview of the most important hypoxia tracers, their prognostic significance and how these tracers can play a role in tomorrows personalized medicine.

AB Gene expression analysis was performed on a human renal cancer cell line (786-0) with mutated VHL gene and a transfectant with wild-type VHL to analyse genes regulated by VHL and to compare with the gene programme regulated by hypoxia. There was a highly significant concordance of the global gene response to hypoxia and genes suppressed by VHL. Cyclin D1 was the most highly inducible transcript and 14-3-3 epsilon was downregulated. There were some genes regulated by VHL but not hypoxia in the renal cell line, suggesting a VHL role independent of hypoxia. However in nonrenal cell lines they were hypoxia regulated. These included several new pathways regulated by hypoxia, including RNase 6PL, collagen type I alpha 1, integrin alpha 5, ferritin light polypeptide, JM4 protein, transgelin and L1 cell adhesion molecule. These were not found in a recent SAGE analysis of the same cell line. Hypoxia induced downregulation of Cyclin D1 in nonrenal cells via an HIF independent pathway. The selective regulation of Cyclin D I by hypoxia in renal cells may therefore contribute to the tissue selectivity of VHL mutation.

AB The present study was undertaken to investigate the dynamic expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension of rats. It was found that mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) increased significantly after 7 d of hypoxia. Pulmonary artery remodeling index and right ventricular hypertrophy became evident after 14 d of hypoxia. HIF-1 alpha mRNA staining was less positive in the control, hypoxia for 3 d and hypoxia for 7 d, but began to enhance significantly after 14 d of hypoxia, then remained stable. Expression of HIF-1 alpha protein in the control was less positive, but was up-regulated in pulmonary arterial tunica intima of all hypoxic rats. TGF-beta 1 mRNA expression in pulmonary arterial walls was increased significantly after 14 d of hypoxia, but showed no obvious changes after 3 or 7 d of hypoxia. In pulmonary tunica adventitia and tunica media, TGF-beta 1 protein staining was less positive in control rats, but was markedly enhanced after 3 d of hypoxia, reaching its peak after 7 d of hypoxia, and then weakening after 14 and 21 d of hypoxia. Western blotting showed that HIF-1 alpha protein levels increased significantly after 7 d of hypoxia and then remained at a high level. TGF-beta 1 protein level was markedly enhanced after 3 d of hypoxia, reaching its peak after 7 d of hypoxia, and then decreasing after 14 and 21 d of hypoxia. Linear correlation analysis showed that HIF-1 alpha mRNA, TGF-beta 1 mRNA, TGF-beta 1 protein were positively correlated with mPAP, vessel morphometry and right ventricular hypertrophy index. TGF-beta 1 protein (tunica adventitia) was negatively correlated with HIF-1 alpha mRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that changes in HIF-1 alpha and TGF-beta 1 expression after hypoxia play an important role in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension of rats.

AB Clinical manifestations of tumors indicate that malignant phenotypes developing in the hypoxic microenvironment lead to resistance to cancer treatment, rendering chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and photodynamic therapy less sensitive and effective in patients with tumor. Visualizing the oxygen level in the tumor environment has garnered much attention due to its implications in precision tumor therapy. Following the rapid development of biomaterials in nanotechnology, various nanomaterials have been designed to visualize the oxygen levels in tumors. Here, we review recent research on detecting oxygen levels in solid tumors for tumor hypoxia imaging. To monitor the hypoxic level of tumors, two main strategies were investigated: directly detecting oxygen levels in tumors and monitoring the hypoxia-assisted reduced microenvironment. We believe that hypoxia as a tumor-specific microenvironment can be a breakthrough in the clinical treatment of tumors.

AB Oxygen is essential for normal cellular functions. Hypoxia impacts various cellular processes, such as metabolism, growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, tumorigenesis, microbial infection, and immune response, mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Hypoxia contributes to the progression and development of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, kidney diseases, and infections. The potential alleviation of hypoxia has been explored through the enzymatic in situ decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, leading to the generation of oxygen. However, challenges such as limited stability restrict the effectiveness of enzymes such as catalase in biomedical and in vivo applications. To overcome these limitations, targeted delivery of the enzymes has been proposed. This review offers a critical comparison of i) current approaches to enhance the in vivo stability of catalase; and ii) the structure, mechanism of action, and kinetics of catalase and catalase-like nanozymes.
   Hypoxia affects cellular processes and plays a significant role in the progression of various human diseases. Stabilizing catalase to enzymatically decompose hydrogen peroxide and generate oxygen in situ presents a promising strategy to alleviate hypoxia. This approach could effectively address current challenges associated with oxygen carriers and generators. image

AB Heart disease remains one of the greatest killers. In addition to genetics and traditional lifestyle risk factors, we now understand that adverse conditions during pregnancy can also increase susceptibility to cardiovascular disease in the offspring. Therefore, the mechanisms by which this occurs and possible preventative therapies are of significant contemporary interest to the cardiovascular community. A common suboptimal pregnancy condition is a sustained reduction in fetal oxygenation. Chronic fetal hypoxia results from any pregnancy with increased placental vascular resistance, such as in preeclampsia, placental infection, or maternal obesity. Chronic fetal hypoxia may also arise during pregnancy at high altitude or because of maternal respiratory disease. This article reviews the short- and long-term effects of hypoxia on the fetal cardiovascular system, and the importance of chronic fetal hypoxia in triggering a developmental origin of future heart disease in the adult progeny. The work summarizes evidence derived from human studies as well as from rodent, avian, and ovine models. There is a focus on the discovery of the molecular link between prenatal hypoxia, oxidative stress, and increased cardiovascular risk in adult offspring. Discussion of mitochondria-targeted antioxidant therapy offers potential targets for clinical intervention in human pregnancy complicated by chronic fetal hypoxia.

AB Tumor hypoxia is a major parameter of radioresistance. Hypoxia PET imaging using several radiotracers (F-Miso, FAZA, Cu-ATSM, EF5 ... ) may help predict response to radiotherapy. Hypoxic area evaluation may also help select patients for hypoxia-targeting drugs, and thus reinforcing radiotherapy effects. Hypoxia imaging may also be fused with radiotherapy planning CT to define radioresistance areas that may be boosted by dose-painting radiotherapy. Despite several difficulties (patient positioning, organ and tumor motion, image definition ... ), targeting hypoxic regions within tumors is one of the most promising research strategies of modern radiotherapy.

AB Crustaceans are often tolerant of hypoxic exposure and many regulate O-2 consumption at low ambient O-2 In acute hypoxia, most increase branchial water flow, and many also increase branchial haemolymph flow, both by an increase in cardiac output and by shunting flow away from the viscera. The O-2-binding affinity of crustacean O-2 carriers increases in hypoxic conditions, as a result of hyperventilation induced alkalosis. In chronic hypoxic exposure some crustaceans do not sustain high ventilatory pumping levels but increased effectiveness of O-2-uptake across the gills is maintained as a result of the build up of metabolites such as lactate and urate which also function to increase the haemocyanin O-2-binding affinity. Chronic exposure to hypoxia also may increase O-2-binding capacity and promote the synthesis of new high O-2-affinity carrier molecules. Exposure to untenable rates or levels of O-2 depletion causes many decapodan crustaceans to surface and ventilate the gills with air. Burrowing crayfish provide an example of animals, which excel in all these mechanisms. Control mechanisms involved in compensatory responses to hypoxia are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether mild hypobaric hypoxic preconditioning provides protection against learning deficit caused by subsequent more severe hypoxia insult. Learning was examined using a passive avoidance task. Three groups of Wistar male rats: the intact and exposed to either severe hypoxia (160 Torr, exposition 3 h) or mild hypobaric hypoxic preconditioning (360 Torr, exposition 2 h, repeated three or six times daily) followed by severe hypoxia, were included in this study. In experiment I a passive avoidance response was acquired in 15 min immediately after hypoxia. In experiment 2 rats were exposed to hypoxia in 60 min after the acquisition of passive avoidance response. The mild hypobaric hypoxic preconditioning significantly attenuated the hypoxia-induced learning deficit in rats in Experiments 1 and 2. In experiment 1 the mild hypobaric hypoxic preconditioning repeated six times was more effective in protection against learning deficit in hypoxia exposed rats than in the case of triple mild hypobaric hypoxic preconditioning.
   The amount of rats suffered irreversible respiratory arrest was also assessed in this study. It was found that 50% of rats exposed to severe hypoxia died in consequence of this pathology, whereas in rats preconditioned before the severe hypoxia only 15% died for this reason. The overall results indicate that the mild hypobaric hypoxic preconditioning significantly increases CNS resistance to severe hypoxia in rats.

AB Hypoxia causes arousal. Therefore, we hypothesized that hypoxia activates the human somatomotor system and should augment tremor. We determined the effects of hypoxia, PETO2 = 45 +/- 2.2 mm Hg, hypocapnia, and the hypocapnic-hypoxic interaction on finger tremor during elastic loading. A total of 12 healthy male volunteers were studied during five conditions: eupnea, hypocapnic hypoxia, eucapnic hypoxia, hypocapnic normoxia, and eucapnic normoxia. Acceleration power spectra were computed to quantify 8-12 Hz tremor. Hypoxia significantly augmented 8-12 Hz physiological tremor (P = 0.002). Furthermore, six subjects (50%) exhibited significantly more tremor during hypocapnic hypoxia (hH) than during eucapnic hypoxia (eH). We conclude that acute hypoxia augments 8-12 Hz physiological tremor, and hypocapnia further augments this tremor in some subjects. As such, hypoxic tremor is activated physiological tremor, and entrainment of spinal alpha-motoneuron activity may be the final common pathway. (C) 3000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Both chronic hypoxia and allergic inflammation induce vascular remodeling in the lung, but only chronic hypoxia appears to cause PH. We investigate the nature of the vascular remodeling and the expression and role of hypoxia-induced mitogenic factor (HIMF/FIZZ1/RELM alpha) in explaining this differential response.
   Methods: We induced pulmonary vascular remodeling through either chronic hypoxia or antigen sensitization and challenge. Mice were evaluated for markers of PH and pulmonary vascular remodeling throughout the lung vascular bed as well as HIMF expression and genomic analysis of whole lung.
   Results: Chronic hypoxia increased both mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy; these changes were associated with increased muscularization and thickening of small pulmonary vessels throughout the lung vascular bed. Allergic inflammation, by contrast, had minimal effect on mPAP and produced no RV hypertrophy. Only peribronchial vessels were significantly thickened, and vessels within the lung periphery did not become muscularized. Genomic analysis revealed that HIMF was the most consistently upregulated gene in the lungs following both chronic hypoxia and antigen challenge. HIMF was upregulated in the airway epithelial and inflammatory cells in both models, but only chronic hypoxia induced HIMF upregulation in vascular tissue.
   Conclusions: The results show that pulmonary vascular remodeling in mice induced by chronic hypoxia or antigen challenge is associated with marked increases in HIMF expression. The lack of HIMF expression in the vasculature of the lung and no vascular remodeling in the peripheral resistance vessels of the lung is likely to account for the failure to develop PH in the allergic inflammation model.

AB A computerised system for non-invasive monitoring of heart and ventilation rates and the time intervals between heart beats and between breaths was developed and used to investigate cardio-respiratory changes in rainbow trout exposed to hypoxia and to combined hypoxia and hypercapnia. Upon exposure to hypoxia and hypoxia-hypercapnia the arterial O2 tension decreased from about 90 mmHg to about 30 mmHg. Acid-base changes were small in hypoxia whereas exposure to combined hypoxia-hypercapnia caused a large extracellular respiratory acidosis. This acidosis was completely compensated within 24h by accumulation of bicarbonate in plasma to concentrations twice the normoxic values. The ventilation rate was increased to higher values in hypoxic-hypercapnic trout than in hypoxic trout. In contrast to previous reports, the heart rate increased in hypoxia. On top of the tachycardia response to hypoxia, the heart rate was governed by circadian rhythms, with higher heart rates during the day than during the night. The time interval between heart beats varied considerably in normoxic fish. Hypoxia strongly reduced this variability, which may originate in a reduced cholinergic tone to the heart. The width of the frequency distribution of the time intervals between breaths was not affected by hypoxia. The degree of cardio-respiratory synchronization was low in both normoxic and in hypoxic and hypoxic-hypercapnic trout.

AB A major feature of solid tumours is hypoxia, decreased availability of oxygen, which increases patient treatment resistance and favours tumour progression. How hypoxic conditions are generated in tumour tissues and how cells respond to hypoxia are essential questions in understanding tumour progression and metastasis. Massive tumour-cell proliferation distances cells from the vasculature, leading to a deficiency in the local environment of blood carrying oxygen and nutrients. Such hypoxic conditions induce a molecular response, in both normal and neoplastic cells, that drives the activation of a key transcription factor; the hypoxia-inducible factor. This transcription factor regulates a large panel of genes that are exploited by tumour cells for survival, resistance to treatment and escape from a nutrient-deprived environment. Although now recognized as a major contributor to cancer progression and to treatment failure, the precise role of hypoxia signalling in cancer and in prognosis still needs to be further defined. It is hoped that a better understanding of the mechanisms implicated will lead to alternative and more efficient therapeutic approaches.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma is a typical hypervascular tumor. Generally, hepatocellular carcinoma is developed through liver cirrhosis induced by chronic liver injury. This chronic injury leads to changes in the cellular property of the liver and subsequently causes fibrogenesis to demolish normal liver blood system. The catastrophe of the normal liver blood system leads to the shortage of blood circulation in the liver and causes hypoxia. Moreover, the increased cellularity due to highly proliferative tumor cells also induces local hypoxia inside hepatocellular carcinoma. Hypoxia can stimulate angiogenesis to support tumor growth by induction of angiogenic factors. Thus hypoxia may be a major cause of hypervasculature of hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently it has been reported that several hypoxia-regulatory factors are closely involved in angiogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The stability and function of these factors can be regulated by interaction with other protein factors and consequently modulate the expression of angiogenic factors depending on oxygen tension. Therefore induction mechanism of hypoxia and the role of hypoxia-regulatory factors could provide new insights into hepatocarcinogenesis and the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB Simple Summary In solid tumors, oxygen concentration varies between different regions. Generally, while oxygen supply is sufficient in the vicinity of blood vessels, the concentration of oxygen gradually drops as the distance from the blood vessel increases. In the regions with low oxygen content (hypoxic regions), cancer cells acquire various malignant properties, like invasiveness, altered metabolism, and therapy resistance, leading to recurrence and poor clinical outcomes of patients. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a major regulator of hypoxia responses. Herein, we summarized how tumor hypoxia activates different mechanisms, in both HIF-dependent and HIF-independent manners, and contributes to the acquisition of chemotherapy resistance. We also discussed the involvement of epigenetic regulation in hypoxia-induced chemoresistance, with a specific example of ATAD2 protein degradation inducing drug resistance under hypoxia. Finally, we briefly reviewed some current clinical trials that target HIF and tumor hypoxia for cancer treatment or therapy sensitization.Abstract In hypoxic regions of malignant solid tumors, cancer cells acquire resistance to conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, causing poor prognosis in patients with cancer. It is widely recognized that some of the key genes behind this are hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, e.g., hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Since HIF-1 activity is suppressed by two representative 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-OGDDs), PHDs (prolyl-4-hydroxylases), and FIH-1 (factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1), the inactivation of 2-OGDD has been associated with cancer therapy resistance by the activation of HIF-1. Recent studies have also revealed the importance of hypoxia-responsive mechanisms independent of HIF-1 and its isoforms (collectively, HIFs). In this article, we collate the accumulated knowledge of HIF-1-dependent and independent mechanisms responsible for resistance of hypoxic cancer cells to anticancer drugs and briefly discuss the interplay between hypoxia responses, like EMT and UPR, and chemoresistance. In addition, we introduce a novel HIF-independent mechanism, which is epigenetically mediated by an acetylated histone reader protein, ATAD2, which we recently clarified.

AB We investigated the effects of two 5-wk periods of intermittent hypoxia on running economy (RE). 11 male and female middle-distance runners were randomly assigned to the intermittent hypoxia group (IHG) or to the control group (CG). All athletes trained for a 13-wk period starting at pre-season until the competition season. The IHG spent additionally 2 h at rest on 3 days/wk for the first and the last 5 weeks in normobaric hypoxia (15-11% FiO(2)). RE, haematological parameters and body composition were determined at low altitude (600 m) at baseline, after the 5(th), the 8(th) and the 13(th) week of training. RE, determined by the relative oxygen consumption during submaximal running, (-2.3 +/- 1.2 vs. -0.3 +/- 0.7 ml/min/kg, P < 0.05) and total running time (+1.0 +/- 0.9 vs. +0.4 +/- 0.5 min, P < 0.05) changed significantly between the IHG and CG only during the first 5-wk period. Haematological and cardiorespiratory changes indicate that the improved RE was associated with decreased cardiorespiratory costs and greater reliance on carbohydrate. Intermittent hypoxia did not affect RE during the second 5-wk period. These findings suggest that the effects of intermittent hypoxia on RE strongly depend on the training phase.

AB In order to better understand the mechanisms affecting erythropoietin (Epo) synthesis and red cell mass. increase under chronic hypoxia, we examined Epo production and erythroid progenitors (CFUE) in rats exposed to normobaric hypoxia for four weeks. Hypoxia induced the rise of hematocrit (Htc), hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and the red blood cell (RBC) number with a plateau in hematocrit values after two weeks. After 24 h of hypoxia, Epo levels were increased 20 ford, followed by a significant decrease. After the first week of hypoxia, the values were still higher than in the controls, but after two weeks Epo levels did not differ significantly from the normal values. The fall of Epo levels coincided with the plateau values of hematocrit, The changes in the CFU-E number followed the changes in Epo concentration: a two fold increase after 24 h of hypoxia; a further increase during the next two weeks reaching a peak on day 14, and then a progressive decrease at the time when Epo concentration was at a normal level. Although decreased, but still higher than normal, the CFU-E number during the last two weeks of hypoxia could be necessary for the maintenance of an achieved steady state under persistent hypoxic conditions with normal Epo concentration sufficient to maintain the existing rate of erythropoiesis.

AB Background. The aim of this review is to provide the information about molecular basis of hypoxia-induced chemoresistance, focusing on the possibility of diagnostic and therapeutic use.
   Results. Hypoxia is a common feature of tumors and represents an independent prognostic factor in many cancers. It is the result of imbalances in the intake and consumption of oxygen caused by abnormal vessels in the tumor and the rapid proliferation of cancer cells. Hypoxia-induced resistance to cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, melphalan, 5-flouoruracil, gemcitabine, and docetaxel has been reported in a number of experiments. Adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxia has important biological effects. The most studied factor responsible for these effects is hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) that significantly contributes to the aggressiveness and chemoresistance of different tumors. The HIF-1 complex, induced by hypoxia, binds to target genes, thereby increasing the expression of many genes. In addition, the expression of hundreds of genes can be also decreased in response to hypoxia in HIF-1 dependent manner, but without the detection of HIF-1 in these genes' promoters. HIF-1 independent mechanisms for drug resistance in hypoxia have been described, however, they are still rarely reported. The first clinical studies focusing on diagnosis of hypoxia and on inhibition of hypoxia-induced changes in cancer cells are starting to yield results.
   Conclusions. The adaptation to hypoxia requires many genetic and biochemical responses that regulate one another. Hypoxia-induced resistance is a very complex field and we still know very little about it. Different approaches to circumvent hypoxia in tumors are under development.

AB Purpose of review
   To summarize the role of hypoxia signaling in skeletal cells.
   Recent findings
   Hypoxia occurs at several stages during bone development. Skeletal cells, like chondrocytes and osteoblasts, respond to this challenge by stabilizing the hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF, which induces the expression of angiogenic factors and promotes glycolysis. The increased delivery of oxygen and nutrients, together with metabolic adaptations, prevent chondrocyte cell death in the growth plate and promote bone formation by osteoblasts. However, excessive HIF levels have to be avoided during bone development as the resulting metabolic maladaptations cause skeletal dysplasia. Recent studies show that HIF also targets other genes to increase bone mass: it decreases osteoclastogenesis by increasing osteoprotegerin expression and represses sclerostin expression by epigenetic mechanisms, resulting in increased bone formation and decreased resorption. Moreover, increased HIF signaling in osteolineage cells promotes primary and metastatic breast tumor growth, and induces erythropoietin (EPO) production, resulting in polycythemia. Finally, HIF can directly or indirectly through increasing EPO levels, induce the expression and processing of FGF23 and may thereby affect mineral homeostasis and vitamin D metabolism.
   Summary
   HIF signaling in skeletal cells not only affects their behavior but also influences erythropoiesis and possibly mineral homeostasis.

AB Hypoxia is caused by insufficient oxygen availability for the organism leading to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues and cells. It has been regarded as a severe threat to human health and it is indeed implicated in pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development and progression of many diseases. Nevertheless, the potential of controlled hypoxia interventions (i.e. hypoxia conditioning) for improving cardio-vascular health is gaining increased attention. However, blood rheology is often a forgotten factor for vascular health while aging and hypoxia exposure are both suspected to alter hemorheological properties. These changes in blood rheology may influence the benefits-risks balance of hypoxia exposure in older individuals. The benefits of hypoxia exposure for vascular health are mainly reported for healthy populations and the combined impact of aging and hypoxia on blood rheology could therefore be deleterious in older individuals.This review discusses evidence of hypoxia-related and aging-related changes in blood viscosity and its determinants. It draws upon an extensive literature search on the effects of hypoxia/altitude and aging on blood rheology. Aging increases blood viscosity mainly through a rise in plasma viscosity, red blood cell (RBC) aggregation and a decrease in RBC deformability. Hypoxia also causes an increase in RBC aggregation and plasma viscosity. In addition, hypoxia exposure may increase hematocrit and modulate RBC deformability, depending on the hypoxic dose, i.e, beneficial effect of intermittent hypoxia with moderate dose vs deleterious effect of chronic continuous or intermittent hypoxia or if the hypoxic dose is too high. Special attention is directed toward the risks vs. benefits of hemorheological changes during hypoxia exposure in older individuals, and its clinical relevance for vascular disorders.

AB Purpose: To investigate if metallothionein, an endogenous chemo- and radioprotectant, is expressed in hypoxic cells in mouse C3H mammary carcinomas and if that expression responds to acute changes in tumor hypoxia.
   Methods and Materials: C3H mammary tumors were established in the hind legs of female CDF, mice. The mice were then subjected to air breathing (chronic hypoxia), carbogen breathing (acute decrease in hypoxia), or hydralazine injection (acute increase in hypoxia). Ninety nainutes after the start of the experiment, tumors were excised, fixed in formalin, and sectioned, Hypoxic cells and metallothionein-containing cells were quantitated by image analysis. Pimonidazole hydrochloride and an IgG, mouse monoclonal antibody were used to detect hypoxia, and a mouse antimetallothionein monoclonal antibody (DAKO) was used to detect Type I and II metallothionein in sets of contiguous tissue sections.
   Results: The distribution of immunostaining intensity for metallothionein was the same in all three groups-heavy in hypoxic cells and light in other regions of the tumors. The acute increase in hypoxia caused by hydralazine injection was accompanied by an increase in metallothionein expression (p = 0.04), Carbogen breathing largely eliminated pimonidazole binding, but metallothionein expression persisted in the tumors of carbogen-breathing mice.
   Conclusions: Hypoxic cells in C3H mammary carcinomas strongly express metallothionein. Metallothionein expression is responsive to acute increases in hypoxia brought about by hydralazine injection. The effectiveness of hydralazine in enhancing the activation of bioreductive cytotoxins might be offset by the increased expression of metallothionein, The persistence of metallothionein in tumors of carbogen-breathing mice might contribute to a residual radioresistance in the tumors, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Hypoxia enhances bronchial responsiveness in sheep and dogs and we recently reported a similar effect in asthmatic subjects.  Activation of a reflex arc due to stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors has been suggested to explain this finding.  We evaluated the contribution of carotid body chemoreceptors to hypoxia-induced bronchial responsiveness in conscious sheep.  Incremental concentrations of aerosolized methacholine were given to each of seven sheep ventilated successively (in a random order) with a normoxic and a hypoxic gas mixture (15% O2 in N2), both before and after peripheral surgical chemodenervation.  Hypoxia alone did not affect lung mechanics in intact or chemodenervated animals.  Bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was significantly increased by hypoxia in intact sheep, as compared to chemodenervated sheep.  We conclude that hypoxia has a stimulating effect on bronchial responsiveness in awake sheep similar to that seen in human patients with asthma.  This increased responsiveness may be mediated by hypoxic stimulation of carotid body chemoreceptors, which in turn may influence the nervous control of airway calibre.

AB Iron and oxygen are essential substance for cellular activity in body tissues. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) can respond to available oxygen changes in the cellular environment and regulate the transcription of a series of target genes. The study was conducted to investigate the effects of iron supplementation on the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and antioxidant status in rats exposed to high-altitude hypoxia environment. Forty rats were divided into control (CON), hypobaric hypoxia (HH), and hypobaric hypoxia plus ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) (9.93 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day) (HFS) and hypobaric hypoxia plus iron glycinate chelate (Fe-Gly) (11.76 mg/kg BW/day) (HFG) groups. Results showed that Fe-Gly effectively alleviated weight loss and intestinal mucosa damage induced by hypobaric hypoxia, whereas FeSO4 aggravated hypobaric hypoxia-induced weight loss, liver enlargement, spleen atrophy, and intestinal damage. Iron supplementation decreased liver superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity (P < 0.01) and increased iron concentration in the liver compared to HH group (P < 0.001). Moreover, Fe-Gly upregulated liver transferrin expression in messenger RNA (mRNA) level (P < 0.05) and downregulated serum erythropoietin (EPO) concentration (P < 0.01) and liver HIF-1 alpha expression level (P < 0.05 in mRNA level; P < 0.001 in protein level) compared to HH group. The study indicated that FeSO4 supplementation at high altitudes aggravated the oxidative damage of tissues and organs that could be mediated through production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and inhibition antioxidant enzyme activities. Fe-Gly can protect hypobaric hypoxia-induced tissues injury. Moreover, iron supplementation at high altitudes affected HIF-1 alpha-mediated regulating expression of targeting genes such as EPO and transferrin. The study highlights that iron supplementation under hypobaric hypoxia environment has possible limitation, and efficient supplementation form and dosage need careful consideration.

AB Objectives: Hypoxia is a hallmark of the tumor microenvironment, and hypoxia regions are frequently found in gastrointestinal cancers, which are associated with worse patients' survival and therapy resistance. However, the potential mechanisms of hypoxic tumor microenvironment still need to be further elucidated, especially about the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in hypoxic tumor regions. In recent years, a great mount of independent research showed that many lncRNAs were modulated by hypoxia, and these lncRNAs were named as "hypoxia-regulated lncRNAs". In this review, the recent developments in the expression, regulation and functions of hypoxia-regulated lncRNAs in gastrointestinal cancers were summarized.
   Materials and methods: In this review, we summarized and figured out recent studies concerning the expression and biological mechanisms of hypoxia-regulated lncRNAs in gastrointestinal cancers. The related studies were obtained through a systematic search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library.
   Results: Hypoxia-regulated lncRNAs have various roles in the regulation of metabolism, autophagy, invasion and metastasis in the hypoxic microenvironment. More importantly, hypoxic-regulated lncRNAs have a variety of potential mechanisms in gastrointestinal tumors, including epigenetic, lncRNA-miRNA interaction, lncRNA-protein interactions.
   Conclusions: Hypoxia-regulated lncRNAs will undoubtedly be developed as targets and promote the progress in ideal therapies for gastrointestinal cancer patients.

   THROMBOSIS; DISEASE
AB Background: Modem air travel entails a cabin altitude between 1520 and 2440m (5000-8000ft) and thus exposure to mild hypoxia. There is debate as to whether hypoxia is causally related to venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurring during or after travel. One study suggested that a short period of hypobaric hypoxia causes activation of coagulation. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that hypoxia alone (normobaric hypoxia) causes activation of coagulation, possibly through endothelial c,11 activation. Methods: Six healthy male volunteers were exposed for 3 h, while seated, on two separate occasions to (i) dry air (control) and (ii) hypoxic gas mixture (12.8% O-2 in N-2, equivalent to breathing air at 3660m [12000ft]). Results: There were no differences in hemostatic or endothelial markers between control and hypoxic groups, but platelet and leukocyte counts increased and were significantly higher in the hypoxic group. There were increases in fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor, as well as theological changes, but these were not significantly different between control and hypoxic groups. Conclusions: This small study does not support the previous suggestion that hypoxia causes activation of coagulation, and suggests that immobility-induced theological changes may be more significant in the etiology of VTE occurring during or after travel.

   HYDROXYLATION; INFLAMMATION; HIF-2-ALPHA
AB Background: We previously reported that iron chelators inhibit TNF alpha-mediated induction of VCAM-1 in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. We hypothesized that iron chelators mediate inhibition of VCAM-1 via inhibition of iron-dependent enzymes such as those involved with oxygen sensing and that similar inhibition may be observed with agents which simulate hypoxia.
   Objective: We proposed to examine whether non-metal binding hypoxia mimetics inhibit TNF alpha-mediated VCAM-1 induction and define the mechanisms by which they mediate their effects on VCAM-1 expression.
   Methods: These studies were undertaken in vitro using immortalized dermal endothelial cells, Western blot analysis, ELISA, immunofluorescence microscopy, quantitative real-time PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation.
   Results: Hypoxia and the non-iron binding hypoxia mimetic dimethyl oxallyl glycine (DMOG) inhibited TNF alpha-mediated induction of VCAM-1. DMOG inhibition of VCAM-1 was dose-dependent, targeted VCAM-1 gene transcription independent of NF-kappa B nuclear translocation, and blocked TNF alpha-mediated chromatin modifications of relevant elements of the VCAM-1 promoter. Combined gene silencing of both HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha using siRNA led to a partial rescue of VCAM expression in hypoxia mimetic-treated cells.
   Conclusion: Iron chelators, non-metal binding hypoxia mimetics, and hypoxia all inhibit TNF alpha-mediated VCAM-1 expression. Inhibition is mediated independent of nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B, appears to target TNF alpha-mediated chromatin modifications, and is at least partially dependent upon HIF expression. The absence of complete VCAM-1 expression rescue with HIF silencing implies an important regulatory role for an Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase distinct from the prolyl and asparagyl hydroxylases that control HIF function. Identification of this dioxygenase may provide a valuable target for modulating inflammation in human tissues.

AB Tissue hypoxia results from an inadequate supply of oxygen (O-2) that compromises biological functions. Structural and functional abnormalities of the tumour vasculature together with altered diffusion conditions inside the tumour seem to be the main causes of tumour hypoxia. Evidence from experimental and clinical studies points to a role for tumour hypoxia in tumour propagation, resistance to therapy and malignant progression. This has led to the development of assays for the detection of hypoxia in patients in order to predict outcome and identify patients with a worse prognosis and/or patients that would benefit from appropriate treatments. A variety of invasive and non-invasive approaches have been developed to measure tumour oxygenation including oxygen-sensitive electrodes and hypoxia marker techniques using various labels that can be detected by different methods such as positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), autoradiography and immunohistochemistry. This review aims to give a detailed overview of non-invasive molecular imaging modalities with radiolabelled PET and SPECT tracers that are available to measure tumour hypoxia.

AB Hypoxia deprives cells of energy and induces severe physical damage in embryophytes. Under hypoxia, the equilibrium between ethylene and H2O2 affects the response of the transcription factor AtERF73/HRE1. To evaluate the role of AtERF73/HRE1 during hypoxia signaling, we used three independent AtERF73/HRE1 knockout lines to detect H2O2 accumulation. The results revealed that under hypoxia, H2O2 accumulation in the AtERF73/HRE1 knockout lines decreased, indicating that AtERF73/HRE1 uses a negative feedback regulation mechanism to influence the production of H2O2 induced through hypoxia signal transduction. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that oxygen deficiency had different effects on the expression of the hypoxia-induced genes Rboh B, D, G, and I in the AtERF73/HRE1 knockout lines. In particular, Rboh B and D expression were increased, whereas Rboh G expression was decreased. The expression of Rboh I was increased at 1 h but decreased at 3 h during hypoxia treatment in the AtERF73/HRE1 knockout lines. Similarly, the transcript levels of antioxidant and hypoxia-induced/ethylene response genes in the AtERF73/HRE1 knockout lines were affected by hypoxic stress, indicating that AtERF73/HRE1 is essential to hypoxia signal transduction in embryophytes. Additionally, in histochemical analysis, AtERF73/HRE1 promoter-induced GUS expression was detected in various plant parts throughout the plant growth process (e.g., leaves, inflorescences, siliques), particularly in the edges of mature leaves and guard cells. Taken together, our results confirm that AtERF73/HRE1 plays a role in H2O2 production by affecting the hypoxia-induced expression of Rboh genes in hypoxia signal transduction.

ID SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; ENSO
AB Marine Heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged, discrete, and anomalously warm events, which have recently gained global attention due to their far-reaching effects and reported impacts. Although inten-sive studies have been carried out at global and regional scales, these events remained understudied in the Philippines - a country with high marine biodiversity. The Philippines is highly vulnerable to the impacts of these extreme events as it lies in the western boundary of the Pacific that is considered as a hotspot for MHWs. The present study used multi-year climatic sea surface temperature (SST) record to detect MHWs in the Philippines. The detected events were then characterized using the standardized metrics. Linear trend analysis was conducted to determine the magnitude and direction of the change of the MHW metrics over time. Decadal trend revealed that MHWs in the Philippines significantly increased from seven MHWs in the 1980s to 37 MHWs in the last decade. Moreover, increased duration was remarkable in 2020 with 276 MHW days. MHW frequency and duration were increasing at a rate almost twice as its neighboring waters. Intensities did not significantly increase with time, but the highest SST anomaly is associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation. Furthermore, the eastern and western region of the Philippines is vulnerable to MHWs, but hotspots are mostly confined in the West Philippine Sea and western tropical Pacific. An in-depth investigation of the drivers of MHWs is recommended to understand the physical mechanisms of the development of these extreme thermal events in the Philippine seas. The findings have significant implications for coastal marine resource management, highlighting the need for adaptive management strategies and increased monitoring and research efforts to mitigate the impacts of MHWs on marine ecosystems and local economies in the Philippines.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective During isometric exercise, the synovial joint tissue is prone to hypoxia, which is further enhanced in the presence of synovial inflammation. Hypoxia is also known to induce inflammatory cascades, suggesting that periodic hypoxia perpetuates synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis. We previously established an ex vivo cellular model of rheumatoid arthritis using the synovial tissue-derived inflammatory cells, which reproduced aberrant synovial overgrowth and pannus-like tissue development in vitro. Using this model, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of synovial cells against hypoxia in rheumatoid arthritis.
   Methods Inflammatory cells that infiltrated synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis were collected without enzyme digestion, and designated as synovial tissue-derived inflammatory cells. Under normoxia or periodic hypoxia twice a week, their single-cell suspension was cultured in medium alone to observe an aberrant overgrowth of inflammatory tissue in vitro. Cytokines produced in the culture supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.
   Results Primary culture of the synovial tissue-derived inflammatory cells under periodic hypoxia resulted in the attenuation of the spontaneous growth of inflammatory tissue in vitro compared to the culture under normoxia. Endogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production was enhanced under periodic hypoxia. When endogenous PGE2 was blocked by indomethacin, the aberrant tissue overgrowth was more enhanced under hypoxia than normoxia. Indomethacin also enhanced the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) under periodic hypoxia compared to normoxia. The EP4-specific antagonist reproduced the effect of indomethacin. Exogenous PGE1 and EP4-specific agonist effectively inhibited the aberrant overgrowth and the production of the inflammatory mediators under periodic hypoxia as well as normoxia.
   Conclusions The enhancing effect of periodic hypoxia on the aberrant overgrowth of rheumatoid synovial tissue was effectively down-regulated by the simultaneously induced endogenous PGE2.

AB The cellular response to hypoxia relies on the activation of a specific transcriptional program. Although, most of the attention is focused on the transcription factor HIF, other transcription factors are also activated in hypoxia. We have recently described the mechanism for hypoxia induced NF kappa B. We have demonstrated the crucial dependency on the IKK complex as well as in the upstream IKK kinase TAK1. TAK1 and IKK activation is dependent upon the calcium calmodulin kinase, CaMK2 and requires Ubc13 as the E2 ubiquitin conjugation enzyme. We report a role for XIAP as the possible E3-ubiquitin ligase for this system. Interestingly, hypoxia induced IKK mediated phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha, does not lead to degradation. Hypoxia prevents I kappa B alpha de-sumoylation of Sumo-2/3 chains on critical lysine residues, normally required for K-48 linked polyubiquitination. Our results define a novel pathway regulating NF kappa B activation.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) have gained attention as a conservation tool for enhancing ecosystem resilience to climate change. However, empirical evidence explicitly linking MPAs to enhanced ecological resilience is limited and mixed. To better understand whether MPAs can buffer climate impacts, we tested the resistance and recovery of marine communities to the 2014-2016 Northeast Pacific heatwave in the largest scientifically designed MPA network in the world off the coast of California, United States. The network consists of 124 MPAs (48 no-take state marine reserves, and 76 partial-take or special regulation conservation areas) implemented at different times, with full implementation completed in 2014. We compared fish, benthic invertebrate, and macroalgal community structure inside and outside of 13 no-take MPAs across rocky intertidal, kelp forest, shallow reef, and deep reef nearshore habitats in California's Central Coast region from 2007 to 2020. We also explored whether MPA features, including age, size, depth, proportion rock, historic fishing pressure, habitat diversity and richness, connectivity, and fish biomass response ratios (proxy for ecological performance), conferred climate resilience for kelp forest and rocky intertidal habitats spanning 28 MPAs across the full network. Ecological communities dramatically shifted due to the marine heatwave across all four nearshore habitats, and MPAs did not facilitate habitat-wide resistance or recovery. Only in protected rocky intertidal habitats did community structure significantly resist marine heatwave impacts. Community shifts were associated with a pronounced decline in the relative proportion of cold water species and an increase in warm water species. MPA features did not explain resistance or recovery to the marine heatwave. Collectively, our findings suggest that MPAs have limited ability to mitigate the impacts of marine heatwaves on community structure. Given that mechanisms of resilience to climate perturbations are complex, there is a clear need to expand assessments of ecosystem-wide consequences resulting from acute climate-driven perturbations, and the potential role of regulatory protection in mitigating community structure changes.

AB The production of lactate under hypoxic conditions or by cancer cells was reported to promote the M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages. However, the exact effect of lactate on macrophages, particularly under hypoxic conditions, has remained largely elusive. In the present study, an in-depth bioinformatics analysis of previously published transcriptome data of macrophages was performed. A total of 6, 101 and 764 upregulated genes were identified in the lactate, hypoxia and hypoxia-lactate groups, respectively, whereas 4, 41 and 588 genes were downregulated in the same respective groups. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the hypoxia and hypoxia-lactate groups were significantly enriched in the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway and the Hedgehog pathway. Upregulation of the mTOR and Hedgehog pathways in the hypoxia-lactate group was identified by gene set enrichment analysis. Furthermore, a set of HIF-1 pathway-associated genes was identified to be positively correlated with hypoxia using weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Lactate was indicated to inhibit the cell cycle in a hypoxia-independent manner. The DEGs of the hypoxia and hypoxia-lactate groups, including C-C motif chemokine receptor type 1 and 5, were enriched in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. In conclusion, under normoxic conditions, lactate exerted a weak effect on macrophages, while the combination of lactate and hypoxia markedly promoted the M2-polarization of macrophages via the HIF-1, Hedgehog and mTOR pathways. Lactate and hypoxia may also contribute to the formation of the spatial structure of tumor niches by inhibiting the proliferation of resident macrophages and by regulating the recruitment of peripheral macrophages.

AB Hypoxia is intrinsic to tumours and contributes to malignancy and metastasis while hindering the efficiency of existing treatments. Epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in the regulation of hypoxic cancer cell programs, both in the initial phases of sensing the decrease in oxygen levels and during adaptation to chronic lack of oxygen. During the latter, the epigenetic regulation of tumour biology intersects with hypoxia-sensitive transcription factors in a complex network of gene regulation that also involves metabolic reprogramming. Here, we review the current literature on the epigenetic control of gene programs in hypoxic cancer cells. We highlight common themes and features of such epigenetic remodelling and discuss their relevance for the development of therapeutic strategies.

AB Tissues require an adequate supply of oxygen in order to maintain normal cell function. Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) is characteristic of a number of conditions, including cancer, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, critical limb ischaemia, peripheral vascular disease, and ischaemic heart disease. Tissue hypoxia is found in tumours, atherosclerotic plaque, and ischaemic myocardium. There is a growing interest in methods to detect and assess hypoxia, given that hypoxia is important in the progression of these diseases. Hypoxia can be assessed at the level of the whole organ, tissue, or cell, using both invasive and non-invasive methods, and by a range of immunohistochemical, biochemical, or imaging techniques. This review describes and critiques current methods of assessing hypoxia that are used at the bench and in clinical practice.

Methods Most up-to-date evidences about how hypoxia contributes to the disease pathogenesis of endometriosis and potential therapeutic approaches were collected by conducting a comprehensive search of medical literature electronic databases. Quality of data was analyzed by experienced experts including gynecologist and basic scientists. Results Uterus is a highly vascularized organ, which makes endometrial cells constantly expose to high concentration of oxygen. When endometrial tissues shed off from the eutopic uterus and retrograde to the peritoneal cavity, they face severe hypoxic stress. Even with successful implantation to ovaries or peritoneum, the hypoxic stress remains as a critical issue because endometrial cells are used to live in the well-oxygenated environment. Under the hypoxia condition, cells undergo epigenetic modulation and evolve several survival processes including steroidogenesis, angiogenesis, inflammation and metabolic switch. The complex gene regulatory network driven by hypoxia ensures endometriotic cells can survive under the hostile peritoneal microenvironment. Conclusion Hypoxia plays critical roles in promoting pathological processes to facilitate the development of endometriosis. Targeting hypoxia-mediated gene network represents an alternative approach for the treatment of endometriosis.

AB Hypoxia has been recognized as one oft he fund a mentally important features of solid tumors and plays a critical role in various cellular and physiologic events, including cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, immunosurveillance, metabolism, as well as tumor invasion and metastasis. These responses to hypoxia are at least partially orchestrated by activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). HIF-1 is a key regulator of the response of mammalian cells to oxygen deprivation and plays critical roles in the adaptation of tumor cells to a hypoxic microenvironment. Hypoxia and overexpression of HIF-1 have been associated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy resistance, an increased risk of invasion and metastasis, and a poor clinical prognosis of solid tumors. The discovery of HIF-1 signaling has led to a rapidly increasing understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in tumor hypoxia and has helped greatly in screening novel anticancer agents. In this review, we will first introduce the cellular responses to hypoxia and HIF-1 signaling pathway in hypoxia, and then summarize the multifaceted role of hypoxia in the hallmarks of human cancers.

AB Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have become more frequent, intense and extreme in oceanic systems in the past decade, resulting in mass mortality events of marine invertebrates and devastating coastal marine ecosystems. While metabolic homeostasis is a fundamental requirement in stress tolerance, little is known about its role under intensifying MHWs conditions. Here, we investigated impacts of MHWs on the metabolism in pearl oysters (Pinctada maxima) - an ecologically and economically significant bivalve species in tropical ecosystems. Activities of digestive enzymes (gastric proteases, lipases, and amylases) did not significantly respond to various scenario of recurrent MHWs varying from 24 degrees C to 28 degrees C (moderate) and 32 degrees C (severe). The metabolomics analysis revealed nine and five key metabolism pathways under both MHWs scenarios. Specifically, pathways associated with energy metabolism were impaired by moderate MHWs, manifesting in downregulation of differential metabolite (The nicotinic acid and N-acetyl-glutamic acid). The content of CDP-ethanolamine was significantly decrease, and the perturbations of oxidative stress caused by the decreased of content of D-glutamine. Metabolites related to a suite of body functions (e.g., the lipid metabolism, biomineralization, and antioxidant defenses) showed significantly negative responses by severe MHWs. These findings reveal the metabolic impairments of marine bivalves when subjected to MHWs varying in intensity and frequency, implying cascading consequences which deserve further investigation.

AB The aim of the investigation was to study the effect of chronic and acute prenatal hypoxia on the parameters of CNS functional activity and to assess the role of mitochondria in the protection of the CNS against experimental hypoxic influence in vivo.
   Materials and Methods. The experiments in vivo were performed on C57BL/6 mice. In order to model chronic prenatal hypoxia, pregnant female mice were placed daily into a hypobaric chamber beginning with the fourteenth day of gestation up to delivery. 280-300 mm Hg pressure corresponding to the altitude of 8000 m above sea level was maintained in the chamber for 2 h. Acute prenatal hypoxia was modeled on the eighteenth day of gestation. Pregnant females were placed for 4-5 min (till the first agonal breath) in the hypobaric chamber under 220-240 mm Hg pressure corresponding to the altitude of 10,000 m above sea level.
   Oxygen consumption rate by mice brain mitochondria was assessed on the first day of the post-natal period using a high-resolution Oxygraph-2k respirometer (Oroboros Instruments, Austria). To determine a general state of the CNS in the remote post-hypoxic period, a neurological status of the 4-week-old animals was evaluated according to the neurological deficit scale for small laboratory animals and Garcia's scale. Mnestic and cognitive abilities were also tested in Morris water maze.
   Results. Protocols of acute and chronic prenatal hypoxia modeling for mice have been designed. Acute hypoxic damage has been shown to result in the significant decrease of the basal oxygen consumption rate and intensity of oxidative phosphorylation by the brain mitochondria of the newborn mice, and in the activation of the respiratory complex II. After chronic prenatal hypoxia, the basal oxygen consumption rate and oxidative phosphorylation intensity significantly increased relative to the intact group.
   Conclusion. The designed protocols of experimental prenatal hypoxia modeling allowed us to reveal a specific pattern of mitochondrial apparatus adaptation to various types of hypoxic damage. Chronic hypoxia leads to adaptation of the mitochondrial apparatus characterized by intensification of oxidative phosphorylation.

AB Hundreds of genes can be regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) under hypoxia. Here we demonstrated a HIF1-mediated induction of protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 3C gene (PPP1R3C) in human MCF7 cells under hypoxia. By mutation analysis we confirmed the presence of a functional hypoxia response element that is located 229 bp upstream from the PPP1R3C gene. PPP1R3C induction correlates with a significant glycogen accumulation in MCF7 cells under hypoxia. Knockdown of either HIF1 alpha or PPP1R3C attenuated hypoxia-induced glycogen accumulation significantly. Knockdown of HIF2 alpha reduced hypoxia-induced glycogen accumulation slightly (but not significantly). Our results demonstrated that HIF1 promotes glycogen accumulation through regulating PPP1R3C expression under hypoxia, which revealed a novel metabolic adaptation of cells to hypoxia.

AB The brain is a vital organ that relies on a constant and adequate supply of blood to match oxygen and glucose delivery with the local metabolic demands of active neurones. It is well established that cerebral blood flow is altered in response to both neural activity and humoral stimuli. Thus, augmented neural activation (e.g. visual stimulation) leads to locally increased cerebral blood flow via functional hyperaemia, whereas humoral stimuli (i.e. alterations in arterial PO2 and PCO2) produce global increases in cerebral blood flow. Perhaps not surprisingly, cerebrovascular responses to neural activity and humoral stimuli may not be highly correlated because they reflect different physiological mechanisms for vasodilation. Exquisite regulation of cerebral blood flow is particularly important under hypoxic conditions when cerebral PO2 can be reduced substantially. Indeed, cerebrovascular reactivity to hypoxia determines the capacity of cerebral vessels to respond and compensate for a reduced oxygen supply. This reactivity is dynamic, changing with prolonged exposure to hypoxic environments, and in patients and healthy individuals exposed to chronic intermittent periods of hypoxia. More recently, a number of animal studies have provided evidence that glial cells (i.e. astrocytes) play an important role in regulating cerebral blood flow under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. This review aims to summarize our current understanding of cerebral blood flow control during hypoxia in humans and put into context the underlying neurovascular mechanisms that may contribute to this regulation.

AB Hypoxia (low oxygen) is a defining physiological feature of a number of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and retinopathy. Hypoxia plays an active role in the pathology of these diseases through its impact on gene expression, thereby making the hypoxia-signaling pathway a key target for the development of novel molecular therapies. This review focuses on how the elucidation of this pathway has led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies, including physiologically targeted gene therapy and the identification of novel therapeutic targets within the hypoxia-signaling pathway.

AB Although physiological and pathological role of hypoxia have been appreciated in mammalians for decades however the cellular biology of hypoxia more clarified in the past 20 years. Discovery of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, in the 1990s opened a new window to investigate the mechanisms behind hypoxia. In different cellular contexts HIF-1 activation show variable results by impacting various aspects of cell biology such as cell cycle, apoptosis, differentiation and etc. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are unique cells which take important role in tissue regeneration. They are characterized by self-renewal capacity, multilineage potential, and immunosuppressive property. Like so many kind of cells, hypoxia induces different responses in MSCs by HIF-1 activation. The activation of this molecule changes the growth, multiplication, differentiation and gene expression profile of MSCs in their niche by a complex of signals. This article briefly discusses the most important effects of hypoxia in growth kinetics, signalling pathways, cytokine secretion profile and expression of chemokine receptors in different conditions.

AB The cellular responses to hypoxia are complex and characterized by alterations in the expression of a number of genes, including stress-related genes and corresponding proteins that are necessary to maintain homeostasis. The purpose of this article is to review previous and recent studies that have examined the changes in the expression and posttranslational modification of proteins in response to chronic sustained and intermittent forms of hypoxia. A large number of studies focused on the analysis of either the single protein or a subset of related proteins using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis to separate a complex set of proteins from solubilized tissues or cell extracts, followed by immunostaining of proteins using antibodies that are specific to either native or posttranslationally modified forms. On the other hand, only a limited number of studies have examined the global perturbations on protein expression by hypoxia using proteomics approach involving two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. Results derived from specific protein analysis of a variety of tissues and cells showed that hypoxia, depending on the duration and severity of the stimulus, affects the level and the state of posttranslational modification of a subset of proteins that are associated with energy metabolism, stress response, cell injury, development, and apoptosis. Some of these earlier findings are further corroborated by recent studies that utilize a global proteomics approach, and, more importantly, results from these proteomics investigations on the effects of hypoxia provide new protein targets for further functional analysis. The anticipated new information stems from the analysis of expression, and posttranslational modification of these novel protein targets, along with gene expression profiles, offers exciting new opportunities to further define the mechanisms of cellular responses to hypoxia and to control more effectively the clinical consequences of prolonged or periodic lack of oxygen.
